# Overview


## Kvasi

**The Quantum Learning Machine**

Quantum computers differ from their classical counterparts when it comes to the basic 
computational operators. Before QPUs can be utilized, they require tailor-made programs 
and algorithms. With Kvasi, the user can explore and develop algorithms 
for quantum computers. Read here [detailed instructions on how to access](../quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi.md)

Kvasi provides an ecosystem for developing and simulating quantum algorithms in both 
ideal, and realistic, noisy conditions. With Kvasi, you can optimize your algorithm 
for a specific hardware (QPU), with specific connections and basic gate operations.

The algorithms can be developed either at a level close to the hardware, using 
the Atos Quantum Assembler (AQASM) language, or using a higher level, Python based 
language and ready-made libraries. The QLM comes with several ready-made examples.
You can also download and run locally [myQLM](../quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi.md#myqlm) - a light-weight version of the 
QLM ecosystem.


## Helmi

**5 Qubit Quantum Computer**

!!! success "FiQCI Pilot Phase is now open!"
    The FiQCI Pilot Phase is now open! [More details about the Pilot Phase](../helmi/lumi-helmi-pilot-phase/).

Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer, built by IQM and operated by VTT. Presently, Helmi provides 5 qubits, and will be upgraded to 20, then 50 qubits in the near future. With Helmi, users can run quantum programmes and algorithms on a platform with real noise and decoherence.

Access to Helmi is provided through LUMI which acts as a portal for Quantum Computing resources. Users will need to apply for a project through LUMI and submit jobs to Helmi through LUMI. Applying for a project is done through [MyCSC](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project/) where the user will need to select "**Helmi**" under "Select LUMI access mode".
