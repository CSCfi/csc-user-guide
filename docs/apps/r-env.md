# R

R is an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. More information on R can be found on the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). A useful set of R manuals is also hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

## Available

The `r-env` module module has been built for diverse use cases and includes 800+ pre-installed R packages, including support for [geospatial analyses](r-env-for-gis.md). Several [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) packages are also included. Bioconductor is an open-source project providing tools for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.

Currently supported R versions:

- 3.6.1

Currently supported Bioconductor versions:

- 3.9 (with R 3.6.1)

Other software included in the module:

## Licenses

Information on licenses that are in use for R and associated software (such as packages) can be found on the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/).

## Usage

#### Loading the module

To use the default version of this module on Puhti, initialize it with:

```
module load r-env
```

Note that Puhti login nodes are [not intended for heavy computing](../computing/overview.md). To use R in Puhti, please either request an interactive job on a compute node or submit a non-interactive batch job in Slurm. 

#### Interactive use

To interactively use R on Puhti's compute nodes, run the following command after initializing the `r-env` module. 

```bash
r_interactive
```

This will launch a bash script that will ask for a number of details needed to start the session:

```bash
How many cores? # No. of processors required
Memory per core (e.g. "1G")? # Memory required for each processor
Hours (e.g. "01")? # Session duration (hours)
Minutes (e.g. "05")? # Session duration (minutes)
Partition? # Which partition to use
Project (use lower-case letters)? # Project ID (i.e. the Unix group)
```

For information on available partitions, see [here](../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md). For sessions requiring more than four cores and/or over 120 GB of memory, please submit a non-interactive batch job instead.

If you prefer to use RStudio for interactive work, `r-env` can be launched together with the `rstudio` module. See the [RStudio documentation](./rstudio.md) for information. 

#### Non-interactive use

Further to interactive jobs, you can run R scripts non-interactively using batch job files. Some examples are included in the following, but also see this [link](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts.md) for general information on batch jobs. All batch job files can be submitted to the batch job system as follows:

```bash
sbatch batch_job_file.sh
```

#### Serial batch jobs

Below is an example for submitting a single-processor R batch job on Puhti. Note that the `test` partition is used, which has a time limit of 15 minutes and is used for testing purposes only. For memory-intensive jobs, we can also list a project-specific temporary directory in `/scratch/<project>`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=r_single_proc
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --partition=test
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env/3.6.1
echo "TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>" > .Renviron
srun Rscript --no-save myscript.R
```

In the above example, one task (`--ntasks=1`) is executed with 1 GB of memory (`--mem-per-cpu=10000`) and a run time of five minutes (`--time=00:05:00`) reserved for the job.

#### Parallel batch jobs

The `r-env` module can be used for parallel computing in several ways. These include multi-core and array submissions, as well as MPI (Message Passing Interface)-based jobs. The module comes with several packages that support multi-node communication via MPI: `doMPI` (used with `foreach`), `future`, `lidR`, `pbdMPI` and `snow`.

Further to the following examples, please see our separate [documentation](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts.md#mpi-based-batch-jobs) on MPI-based jobs. You may also wish to check the relevant R package manuals and [this page](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/contours) for examples of parallel computing using the `RSAGA` package.

!!! note
    For jobs employing the Rmpi package, please use snow (which is built on top of Rmpi). Jobs using Rmpi alone, e.g. via the srun Rmpi command, are currently unavailable due to compatibility issues.

*Multi-core and array jobs*

To submit a job employing multiple cores on a single node, one could use the following batch job file. The job reserves eight cores (`--ntasks=8`) and a total of 8 GB of memory (`--mem-per-cpu=1000)`. The run time is limited to five minutes.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=r_multi_proc
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --partition=test
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=8
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env/3.6.1
echo "TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>" > .Renviron
srun Rscript --no-save myscript.R
```

Array jobs can be used to handle *embarrassingly parallel* tasks (see [here](../computing/running/array-jobs.md) for information). The following script would submit a job involving ten subtasks on the `small` partition, with each requiring less than five minutes of computing time and less than 1 GB of memory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=r_array
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --output=output_%j_%a.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j_%a.txt
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --array=1-10
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env/3.6.1
echo "TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>" > .Renviron
srun Rscript --no-save myscript.R $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```

*Jobs using `doMPI` (with `foreach`)*

The `foreach` package implements a for-loop that uses iterators and allows for parallel execution using the `%dopar%` operator. It is possible to execute parallel `foreach` loops on Puhti using the `doMPI` package. While otherwise the batch job file looks similar to that used for a multi-processor job, we could modify the `srun` command at the end of the batch job file:

```bash
srun Rscript --no-save --slave myscript.R
```

The `--slave` argument is optional and will prevent different processes from printing out a welcome message etc.

Unlike when using `snow`, jobs using `doMPI` launch a number of R sessions equal to the number of reserved cores that all begin to execute the given R script. It is important to include the `startMPIcluster()` call near the beginning of the R script as anything before it will be executed by all available processes (while only the master process continues after it). Upon completion, the cluster is closed using `closeCluster()`. The `mpi.quit()` function can then be used to terminate the MPI execution environment and to quit R:

```r
library(doMPI, quietly = TRUE)
cl <- startMPIcluster()
registerDoMPI(cl)

system.time(a <- foreach(i = 1:7) %dopar% system.time(sort(runif(1e7))))
a

closeCluster(cl)
mpi.quit()
```

*Jobs using `snow`*

Whereas most parallel R jobs can be submitted using `srun Rscript`, those involving the package `snow` need to be executed using a separate command (`RMPISNOW`). For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=r_snow
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --partition=test
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=8
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env/3.6.1
echo "TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>" > .Renviron
srun RMPISNOW --no-save --slave -f myscript.R
```

Unlike when using `foreach` and `doMPI`, here only the master process runs the R script. The R script must contain the call `getMPIcluster()` that is used to produce a reference to the cluster which can then be passed onto other functions. Upon completion of the analysis, the cluster is stopped using `stopCluster()`. For example:

```r
cl <- getMPIcluster()

funtorun <- function(k) {
  system.time(sort(runif(1e7)))
}

system.time(a <- clusterApply(cl, 1:7, funtorun))
a

stopCluster(cl)
```

*Jobs using `pbdMPI`*

In analyses using the `pbdMPI` package, each process runs the same copy of the program as every other process while operating on its own data. In other words, there is no separate master process as in `snow` or `doMPI`. Executing batch jobs using `pbdMPI` on Puhti can be done using the `srun Rscript` command. For example, we could submit a job with four tasks divided between two nodes (with two tasks allocated to each node):

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=r_pbdmpi
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --partition=test
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env/3.6.1
echo "TMPDIR=/scratch/<project>" > .Renviron
srun Rscript --no-save --slave myscript.R
```

As an example, this batch job file could be used to execute the following "hello world" script (original version available via the `pbdMPI` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snoweye/pbdMPI)). The `init()` function initializes the MPI communicators while `finalize()` is used to shut them down and to exit R.

```r
library(pbdMPI, quietly = TRUE)

init()

message <- paste("Hello from rank", comm.rank(), "of", comm.size())
comm.print(message, all.rank = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)

finalize()
```

#### R package installations

It is possible to check if a particular package is already installed as follows.

```r
# One way is to try loading the package:
library(packagename)

# If you don't want to load the package, it is also
# possible to search through a list:
installed_packages <- library()$results[,1]
"packagename" %in% installed_packages

# Note: both ways are sensitive to upper- and lower-case letters
```

Additional R package installations can be arranged via two separate routes:

- Project-specific installations can be used by creating a separate package directory in the `/projappl/<project>` directory (instructions below; also see [here](../computing/disk.md#projappl-directory) for information on ProjAppl)

- Requests for general installations (provided to all users as part of the module): please contact [servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi)

To make use of a project-specific package library, follow these instructions. First create a new folder inside your project directory:

```r
# On the command prompt:
# First navigate to /projappl/<project>, then
mkdir project_rpackages
```

Then you can add the folder to your library trees in R:

```r
# Add this to your R code:
.libPaths(c("/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages", .libPaths()))
libpath <- .libPaths()[1]

# This command can be used to check that the folder is now visible:
.libPaths() # It should be first on the list

# Package installations should now be directed to the project
# folder by default. You can also specify the path, e.g.:
install.packages("package", lib = libpath)
```

To use R packages installed in the `/projappl` folder, you have two options.

- Option 1: Add `.libPaths(c("/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages", .libPaths()))` to the beginning of your R script. This modifies your library trees within a given R session only. In other words, you will need to run this each time when launching R.

- Option 2: Before launching R, run `export R_LIBS_USER=$R_LIBS_USER:/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages`. This modifies your library settings outside R, which can be useful if you are planning to use R in combination with other software.

## Working with Allas

The `r-env` module comes with the [`aws.s3`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aws.s3/) package for working with S3 storage, which makes it possible to use the Allas storage system directly from an R script. See [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/R/allas/working_with_allas_from_R_S3.R) for a practical example involving raster data.
