# PyTorch

Machine learning framework for Python.

!!! News

    PyTorch is now available on Mahti with GPU support in the new Mahti-AI
    partition. 

    All PyTorch modules on Mahti, and Puhti modules starting from PyTorch version
    1.7, will be based on Singularity by default. This is mainly due to the
    performance issues of conda-based environments on shared file systems, causing
    long start-up delays for Python scripts on CSC's supercomputers. For more 
    information, see the [Singularity section in our machine learning
    guide](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#singularity).

All modules include [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and related libraries with
GPU support via CUDA.

If you find that some package is missing, you can often install it yourself with
`pip install --user`. If you think that some important PyTorch-related package
should be included in the module provided by CSC, you can send an email to
[servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi).

Some modules are Singularity-based (indicated in the "Environ." column in the
table above). Wrapper scripts have been provided so that common commands such as
`python`, `python3`, `pip` and `pip3` should work as normal. For more
information, see the [Singularity section in our machine learning
guide](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#singularity).

Some modules support [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/), which is our recommended
framework for multi-node jobs, i.e., jobs needing more than 4 GPUs. For more
information, read the [Multi-GPU section in our machine learning
guide](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#multi-gpu-and-multi-node-jobs).


### NVIDIA's containers

For convenience, we also offer modules based on NVIDIA's optimized container
images from [NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch) with
some CSC specific additions. For these, the included PyTorch versions are
typically not the release versions, but the newest git commit at the time of
creation. See [NVIDIA's PyTorch container release
notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html)
for more information on provided software versions. Currently, these are
available on **Puhti only**.

- 1.7.0a0 with *experimental* [Horovod](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#multi-gpu-and-multi-node-jobs) support using [Singularity](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#singularity): `pytorch/nvidia-20.08-py3`

## License

PyTorch is BSD-style licensed, as found in the [LICENSE
file](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Usage

To use this software on Puhti or Mahti, initialize it with:

```text
module load pytorch
```

to access the default version, or if you wish to have a specific version ([see
above for available versions](#available)):

```text
module load pytorch/1.8
```

Please note that the module already includes CUDA and cuDNN libraries, so
**there is no need to load cuda and cudnn modules separately!**

This command will also show all available versions:

```text
module avail pytorch
```

To check the exact packages and versions included in the loaded module you can
run:

```text
list-packages
```


!!! note 

    Note that login nodes are not intended for heavy computing, please use slurm
    batch jobs instead. See our [instructions on how to use the batch job
    system](../computing/running/getting-started.md).

### Example batch script

Example batch script for reserving one GPU and 1/4 of the available CPU cores in
a single node:

**Puhti**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10
#SBATCH --mem=64G
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1
    
module load pytorch/1.8
srun python3 myprog.py <options>
```

**Mahti**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=<project>
#SBATCH --partition=gpusmall
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1

module load pytorch/1.8
srun python3 myprog.py <options>
```


!!! note

    Please **do not read a huge number of files from the shared file system**, use
    fast local disk or package your data into larger files instead! See the [Data
    storage section in our machine learning
    guide](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md#data-storage) for more details.

### Big datasets, multi-GPU and multi-node jobs

Please see our [guide for GPU-accelerated machine
learning](../support/tutorials/gpu-ml.md), which covers more advanced topics,
including how to work with big data sets, multi-GPU and multi-node jobs.
