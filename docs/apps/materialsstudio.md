# Materials Studio

Materials Studio is a versatile modelling suite for building and performing
quantum and classical simulation of molecules, materials and nanostructures.

!!! Note
    The national Materials Studio license provided by CSC ended at the end of 2022.
    It is no longer available, starting 2023. Please consider using, e.g., 
    [Maestro](./maestro.md) or [AMS](ams.md) instead.

## License

Materials Studio is a commercial program by [Biovia Inc.](https://3dsbiovia.com/)
CSC has purchased a national academic license for the year 2022 that allows non-profit
usage in Finnish institutes providing higher education (for example
universities). If you're new to Materials Studio, consider also [Maestro](maestro.md)
and [AMS](ams.md).
