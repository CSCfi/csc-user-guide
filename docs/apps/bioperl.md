# Bioperl


## Description

Bioperl is a collection of perl modules that facilitate the development of 
perl scripts for bioinformatics applications. As such, it does not include 
ready to use programs in the sense that many commercial packages and free 
web-based interfaces do. On the other hand, bioperl does provide reusable 
perl modules that facilitate writing perl scripts for sequence manipulation, 
accessing of databases using a range of data formats and execution and parsing 
of the results of various molecular biology programs. Consequently, bioperl 
enables developing scripts that can analyze large quantities of sequence 
data in ways that are typically difficult or impossible with web based systems.
