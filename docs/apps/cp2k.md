# CP2K

Versatile ab initio and classical molecular dynamics. CP2K is suited for large parallel quantum chemistry calculations, in
particular for AIMD.

[TOC]

## Available

* Puhti: 6.1
* Mahti: 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1 (linked to Gromacs for QM/MM), 8.2, 9.1

## License

CP2K is freely available under the GPL license.

## Usage

Check which versions can be loaded directly:

    module avail cp2k

You can find all installed versions with:

    module spider cp2k

With each new project make sure that your job can efficiently
utilize all the cores you request in the batch script.

### Example batch script for Puhti using MPI-only parallelization

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2GB
#SBATCH --partition=large
#SBATCH --account=<project>

module load cp2k

srun cp2k.popt H2O-32.inp > H2O-32.out
```

### Example batch script for Mahti using mixed MPI-OpenMP parallelization

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=32  # 2 - 128
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4     # 128 / ntasks-per-node
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --partition=test
#SBATCH --account=<project>

module purge
module load gcc/10.3.0 openmpi/4.1.0
module load cp2k/9.1-omp

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
export OMP_PLACES=cores

srun cp2k.psmp H2O-32.inp > H2O-32.out
```

### Performance notes

**Mahti:**

The following table shows average time [s] for one AIMD step for the [H2O-64 benchmark](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/benchmarks/QS/H2O-64.inp)
in Mahti. The column headers show how many omp-threads were used per mpi-task.

Nodes|d1|d2|d4|d8
-|--|--|--|--
1|1.048|1.03|*0.97*|1.088
2|0.772|0.678|*0.578*|0.786
4|0.72|0.494|0.504|0.534

* For 64 water molecules, the best performance is obtained with 2 full nodes, 32 mpi-tasks,
  and 4 OMP-threads per task (like the [Mahti example](#example-batch-script-for-mahti-using-mixed-mpi-openmp-parallelization))
  For this system the performance does not scale beyond 2 nodes.
* Mixed parallization is efficient: choose tasks and threads so that they add up to 128
  (physical) cores available per node (or up to 40 on Puhti).
* Test for optimal run parameters for your model system and method.
* Versions linked with ELPA (`cp2k/7.1-elpa`, `cp2k/8.2-omp`, `cp2k/9.1-omp`) are
  significantly faster with (metallic) systems that require large matrix diagonalizations
  for SCF.
* There are additional 7.1 versions available at `/appl/soft/chem/cp2k/7.1_extra`, please
  see corresponding `README.txt`, but `cp2k/7.1-elpa` is the fastest found so far.

### High-throughput computing with CP2K

High-throughput computations can be run conveniently with CP2K using the built-in `FARMING` program. This is an excellent option for use cases where the aim is to run a large amount of independent computations, such as when generating data for AI/ML pipelines. All subjobs are run in parallel within a single Slurm allocation, thus avoiding excess calls of `srun` or `sbatch` which decreases the load on the batch queue system.

Running `FARMING` jobs requires an additional input file in which the details of the workflow, such as the input directories and number of parallel task groups, are specified. Example `farming.inp` and `farming.sh` input and batch script files are provided below. Note that `RUN_TYPE` is set to `NONE` in the `&GLOBAL` section.

```
&GLOBAL
  PROJECT my-farming-job
  PROGRAM FARMING
  RUN_TYPE NONE
&END GLOBAL
&FARMING
  NGROUPS 8
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run1
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run2
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run3
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run4
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run5
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run6
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run7
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
  &JOB
    DIRECTORY run8
    INPUT_FILE_NAME nacl.inp
  &END JOB
&END FARMING
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --time=00:30:00
#SBATCH --partition=medium
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=128
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --account=<project>

module purge
module load gcc/10.3.0 openmpi/4.1.0 cp2k/8.2-omp

srun cp2k.psmp farming.inp >> farming.out
```

In this particular example, one full Mahti node is requested for running 8 single-point calculations of a NaCl crystal with different lattice constants. In addition to the `farming.inp` input, each subjob requires its own ordinary input file, which are here organized into separate subdirectories named `run*`. Issuing `sbatch farming.sh` in the parent directory launches all calculations in parallel, allocating 16 cores to each subjob.

Note that dependencies can also be specified between subjobs using the `DEPENDENCIES` and `JOB_ID` keywords under the `&JOB` section. This enables the definition of complex workflows. For further details, see the [CP2K manual](https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/FARMING.html) and [regtest files for example inputs](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/tests/FARMING).
