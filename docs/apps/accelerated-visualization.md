Accelerated visualization is available as an interactive application via the
Puhti web interface. On LUMI, GPU accelerated graphical applications can be run
through the regular Desktop app by selecting the `lumid` partition.

## More information

More information on Accelerated visualization, interactive applications, and
the web interfaces can be found under the
[Computing section](../computing/index.md):
