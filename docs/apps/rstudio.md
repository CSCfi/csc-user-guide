## Available

The `rstudio` module on Puhti supports the following RStudio Desktop versions:

- 1.2.5019

## Licenses

The RStudio Desktop installation on Puhti is based on the [Open Source Edition](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop) (available under the [AGPL v3 license)](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/master/COPYING).

## Usage

#### Loading the module

To use this module on Puhti, initialize it after loading the `r-env` module (note that `r-env` needs to be loaded in order to use `rstudio`):

```
module load r-env
module load rstudio
```

For information on `r-env`, see the user documentation [here](./r-env.md). Note that Puhti login nodes are [not intended for heavy computing](../computing/overview.md). To use RStudio in Puhti, please request an interactive job on a compute node.

#### Interactive use

To interactively use RStudio on Puhti's compute nodes, run the following command.

```bash
rstudio_interactive
```

This will launch a bash script that will ask for a number of details needed to initialize the session:

```bash
How many cores? # No. of processors required
Memory per core (e.g. "1G")? # Memory required for each processor
Hours (e.g. "01")? # Session duration (hours)
Minutes (e.g. "05")? # Session duration (minutes)
Partition? # Which partition to use
Project (use lower-case letters)? # Project ID (i.e. the Unix group)
```

For information on available partitions, see [here](../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md).
