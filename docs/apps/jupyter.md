# Jupyter

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) develops and maintains interactive
computational environments, including the ever-popular
[computational notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook).

Jupyter interfaces such as Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab come pre-installed
with the [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
kernel, which allows working on notebooks using the
[Python programming language](./python.md). Our web interface also includes an
[interactive Julia-Jupyter app](../computing/webinterface/julia-on-jupyter.md)
using the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)
kernel for working with the [Julia language](./julia.md).

## Available

- Mahti
- Puhti
- LUMI

## License

Jupyter is released under the [modified BSD
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

## Usage

Jupyter can be used on CSC supercomputers through interactive applications
on our web interface:

- [Jupyter interactive application](../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md)
  (IPython kernel)
- [Julia-Jupyter interactive application](../computing/webinterface/julia-on-jupyter.md) (IJulia kernel)

Jupyter can also be used through the
[LUMI web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/jupyter/).
