# VMD

VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting.

## Available

-   Puhti: 1.9.3
-   Mahti: 1.9.3

## License

-  The use of the software is restricted to non-commercial research. [Detailed license description.](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/LICENSE.html)    

## Usage

Initialize with:

```bash
module load vmd/1.9.3 
```

Note, that you need remote graphics to work with VMD. Due to the heavy graphics required by VMD we recommend to use it through [the Puhti web interface remote desktop](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). If you intend to run VMD interactively on Mahti you can use [NoMachine](nomachine.md) as a fallback option. Please don't run VMD on the login nodes.
