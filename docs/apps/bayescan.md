# BayeScan

## Description

BayeScan aims at identifying candidate loci under natural selection from genetic data, using differences in allele frequencies 
between populations. The analysis is based on the multinomial-Dirichlet model.

## Version

*   BayescanÂ 2.1 is available in Puhti

## Usage

To use BayeScan, first run command
```text
module load biokit
```
After that you can launch bayescan with a command like:
```text
bayescan_2.1 -threads 1 test_binary_AFLP.txt 
```

With bayescan_2.1 it is important to define the number of threads
always explisitely. This is because by default BayeScan tries
to use all available cores.

In Puhti, BayeScan tasks should be executed as batch jobs.
Below is a sample batch job file for BayeScan:

```text
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=bayescan
#SBATCH --account=project_XXXXXX
#SBATCH --time=08:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=6G
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load biokit

bayescan_2.1 -threads ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} test_binary_AFLP.txt > bayescan_omp.out
```


The script above reserves 8 hours of computing time, 6GB of memory and 4 computing cores. The XXXXXX in the --account definition
should be replaced with the ID number of your computing project. The job can be submitted to the batch job system with command:
```text
sbatch script
```
Don't use BayeScan with more than 8 cores (execpt if you have verified that your task really benefits from larger core numbers).

More instructions for running batch jobs can be found form [CSC batch job instructions](../computing/running/getting-started.md)
