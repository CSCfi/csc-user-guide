# AlphaFold



AlphaFold is an AI system developed by [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence.

## Available

-   Puhti: 2.0.1, 2.3.0, 2.3.2-1


## Usage

To initialize in Puhti use:

```bash
module load alphafold
```

The following instructions are for versions starting from 2.3.2-1. For older versions
see the help message printed out by `module load` command.

Loading the AlphaFold module will print out commands you can use to check the available
command line options, e.g:

```bash
python3 $ALPHAFOLD_DIR/run_singularity.py --helpshort
```

There are example batch job scripts available:

```text
$ALPHAFOLD_DIR/alphafold_cpu.slurm
$ALPHAFOLD_DIR/alphafold_gpu.slurm
```


### Which version to use

AlphaFold analysis consists of three stages:
  - Multiple sequence alignment (CPU only)
  - Structure prediction (GPU enabled)
  - Optional: Chain relaxation (GPU enabled)

Building the multiple sequen alignments takes a considerable amount of time, and in 
case of short and simple sequences using GPU will only speed up the overall time a 
litle. In these cases you will probably get better throughput using the CPU version, 
as there are more CPU resources available.

In case of longer and more complex strutures GPU will speed up the process
considerably. 

It may be difficult to know beforehand, so do some testing. If the run is taking 
more than 3-4 hours on CPU, you should try using GPU.


### Database

AlphaFold needs a set of sequence databases to run. The total size of of these
databases is almost 3 TiB.

CSC maintains a copy of these databases compatible with the latest version of 
AlphaFold. Databases are mounted on all compute nodes in path `/mnt/datasets/alphafold`.
The path to databases is set with variable `$ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR`. See example batch
job scripts for usage.

```bash
export ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR=/mnt/datasets/alphafold
```

Due to the size of these databases CSC is only able to maintain one copy. If
you need a different version, you will need to download your own copy.

You can follow the [download instructions](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold#genetic-databases) on the AlphaFold home page.

```bash
apptainer exec --bind /scratch $SING_IMAGE /scripts/download_all_data.sh <DOWNLOAD_DIR>
```

AlphaFold is very disk I/O heavy, so for use the databases should be copied to 
$LOCAL_SCRATCH. Even if copying takes some time (depends on file system load on
Puhti, but typically ~1 h) the net gain on run time is considerable.

When copying databases from /scratch to $LOCAL_SCRATCH, you should avoid overloading 
the file system on /scratch, so aggressive multi-threaded copying approaches should 
be avoided.

Use for example:

```bash
cd $LOCAL_SCRATCH
cp -r /scratch/project_12345/alphafold_db .
export ALPHAFOLD_DATADIR=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/alphafold_db
```
