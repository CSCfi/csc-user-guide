# Octave

GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.

## References

In view of the many contributions made by numerous developers over many years it is common courtesy to cite Octave in publications when it has been used during the course of research or the preparation of figures. The citation function can automatically generate a recommended citation text for Octave or any of its packages. See the help text below on how to use citation.

```bash
> citation
> citation <package>
```

Above commands will display instructions for citing GNU Octave or its packages in publications. When called without an argument, display information on how to cite the core GNU Octave system. When given a package name package, display information on citing the specific named package. Note that some packages may not yet have instructions on how to cite them.
