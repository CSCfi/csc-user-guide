# SAGA GIS

[Saga GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/) (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) is a GIS application for spatial data editing and GIS analyses. It can be used with a graphical user interface, command line tools or through the R package `Rsagacmd` or `RSAGA`. Since the `RSAGA` package is no longer actively maintained and has not been tested on newer SAGA GIS versions, we recommend using `Rsagacmd` with SAGA GIS 7.9.0.

## Available

__SAGA GIS__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* 7.10.0 in `r-env-singularity/4.0.4` and `r-env-singularity/4.0.4` modules
* 7.9.0 in `r-env-singularity/4.0.2` and `r-env-singularity/4.0.3` modules
* 7.3.0 in `r-env-singularity/3.6.3` module
* 7.2.0 in `saga-gis` module

## Usage with r-env-singularity module

SAGA GIS is installed in the general R module in Puhti. It is a Singularity container which means the commands are slightly different compared to old installations.

Before running anything, you should first start an [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) on a computing node and load `r-env-singularity ` module.

```
sinteractive -i
module load r-env-singularity 
```

You can test that SAGA GIS loaded successfully and print the command line tools help information with

```
singularity_wrapper exec saga_cmd -h
```

If you have connected with [NoMachine](nomachine.md) or have X11 enabled on your SSH connection, you can launch a graphical user interface with

```
singularity_wrapper exec saga_gui
```

For more information on running R jobs on Puhti, please see the [`r-env-singularity` documentation](r-env-singularity.md).

## Usage with old saga-gis module

Same commands for older SAGA GIS 7.2.0 version

```
sinteractive -i
module load gcc/9.1.0 saga-gis
saga_cmd -h
saga_gui
```
