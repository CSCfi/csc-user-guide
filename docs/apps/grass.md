# GRASS GIS

[GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a free Geographic Information System (GIS) software used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization.

## Available

__GRASS__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* GRASS 7.4

## Usage

In Puhti GRASS GIS is installed inside the [QGIS singularity installation](qgis.md)

It can be loaded with

```
module load qgis
```

After loading the module you can use the GRASS GIS graphical user interface from an interactive session with 

```
sinteractive -i
grass
```

You can also use the command line tools that come in GRASS. See the [GRASS GIS manual](https://grass.osgeo.org/learn/manuals/) for more information. 

For GRASS commands to work in Puhti, you need to add `singularity_wrapper exec` before the GRASS commands. 

For example printing the instructions for the command grass74

```
singularity_wrapper exec grass74 -h
```

!!! note
    The recommended way of using graphical interfaces in Puhti is through [NoMachine](nomachine.md) and an [interactive batch job](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md)
