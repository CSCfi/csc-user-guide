# GRASS GIS

[GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a free Geographic Information System (GIS) software used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization.

## Available

__GRASS__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* GRASS 7.8.5 with default qgis module
* GRASS 7.4 with older qgis/3.16 module

## Usage

### GRASS GIS Command Line Interface

GRASS GIS command line tools can be used in an [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) or [batch jobs](../computing/running/getting-started.md). For using GRASS GIS, see [exmples for using GRASS GIS commands in Puhti with GRASS bash scripting, Python scripting or PyGRASS](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/grass).

### GRASS GIS Graphical User Interface

Using GRASS GIS in [Puhti web interface with Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md).
