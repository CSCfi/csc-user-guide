# Seismic Unix

[Seismic Unix](https://wiki.seismic-unix.org/start) is a seismic processing package. It aims first at delivering a robust and efficient seismic reflection software package, dedicated to education, and to permit the processing of moderate size 2D seismic or GPR data sets.


## Available

__Seismic Unix__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* 44R28


## Usage

Seismic Unix is available in the __seismic-unix__ module:

```
module load seismic-unix
<commands>
```
Seismic Unix can be used in Puhti with command-line or graphical interface, as interactive job or with batch system. In any case reserve suitable amount of computing resources: cores and memory. 

### Seismic Unix with Graphical User Interface

Seismic Unix Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be started in Puhti web interface:

1. Log in to [Puhti web interface](https://puhti.csc.fi).
2. Open [Desktop app](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md)
3. After launching the Desktop, open Terminal

```
module load seismic-unix
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>
<commands>
```

### Working with Seismic Unix interactively
For relatively short analysis jobs, it is possible to use Seismic Unix in [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md).

```
sinteractive -i
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>
module load seismic-unix
<commands>
```

### Using Seismic Unix with batch job
For longer analysis jobs, Puhti batch system should be used.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=project_200xxxx
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --time=00:15:00
#SBATCH --mem=4G

module load seismic-unix
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/<location_of_your_data>
<commands>
```

## Installation

Seismic Unix was installed to Puhti with Apptainer using commands listed in [Seismic Unix Apptainer definition file written by CSC](https://github.com/CSCfi/singularity-recipes/blob/main/seismic-unix/44R28.def). 
Because the `make install` asks a few questions, that need to be answered interactively, the container was first created in [sandbox mode](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/build_a_container.html#creating-writable-sandbox-directories) 
and then converted to normal Apptainer container.

The container was finally wrapped with [Tykky's wrap-container functionality](../computing/containers/tykky.md#container-based-installations): `wrap-container -w /usr/local/cwp/bin su.sif --prefix 44R28`

Additionally `common.sh` of Tykky created files was edited to add 2 required environment variables:
* Edit the end: `export SINGULARITYENV_DEFAULT_PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/cwp/bin/"`
* Add new row: `export SINGULARITYENV_CWPROOT="/usr/local/cwp"`
