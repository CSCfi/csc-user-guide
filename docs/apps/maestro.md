# Maestro

Schrödinger Maestro is a versatile molecular modelling environment. It has modules
for *drug design* and *Materials Science*. It can be used to build, edit, run and analyse 
chemical model systems.

[TOC]

## Available

Puhti: 2019.3, 2019.4, 2020.1


## License

Maestro is available for all academic users: staff and students.
The Maestro license consists of floating licenses and tokens.
It is possible for one user to take up all licenses for a 
certain module. If licenses run out, contact Atte via [ServiceDesk](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi).
Using Maestro means that you accept the
[EULA](https://www.schrodinger.com/maestro-academic-eula).

## Usage

It is recommended to download and install Maestro on your 
own computer, see below.

### Local Installation

Maestro can be installed on a Linux, Mac or Windows computer.
Download the appropriate files from [www.schrodinger.com](https://www.schrodinger.com/)
You don't need a license to _download_ the software, although you need to register
to the Schrödinger website, but you'll need
to configure licensing before you can _run_ it.
[These instructions to configure licensing](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130528861)
require Haka authentication. Access to the license requires that
your computer is in FUNET network, e.g. you're on the university
or connected to it via VPN from home.

### Standalone usage on Puhti

It is possible to run the heavy computations on Puhti. To do that you need to
[get a CSC accountCSC](../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) and 
apply for [access to Puhti](../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md). Before you start
the actual workflow below, you need to set up your Maestro environment on Puhti.

These first four steps you only need to do once

1. ssh to Puhti
     * `ssh your-username@puhti.csc.fi`
1. `module load maestro`
     * Make sure you use the same version as on your local computer
1. An error may appear on your screen. If it asks you to run a script to generate the hosts file. Run it (copy paste it to the command line)
     * If you change Maestro version, you should do the same.
     * Now you have your own `schrodinger.hosts` file in your `$HOME` directory
1. Copy the HOST descriptions from the `schrodinger.hosts` file on Puhti to your local hosts file on your computer
     * Copy everything starting from `name:    test` and paste it at the end of your local `schrodinger.hosts` file
     * This step may need administrator privileges

For actual simulations we recommend using Puhti as follows:

1. Set up your simulations on your local computer
1. write the GUI generated input files on disk
1. copy them to Puhti 
1. edit the script (`your-jobname.sh`) if needed
1. submit the job on the Puhti command line
1. copy the results back for analysis

The overall process is shown in the video below, and additional details and some diagnostics tips
are explained in our [Maestro power usage tutorial](../support/tutorials/power-maestro.md)

!!! note
    Note, that Maestro jobs
    are not run via batch scripts like most other applications at CSC, but
    via Schrödinger binaries using options.

For example, a Desmond workflow could be run with:

```
"${SCHRODINGER}/utilities/multisim" -JOBNAME 2hhb_test -HOST gputest  \
-maxjob 1 -cpu 1 -m 2hhb_test.msj -c 2hhb_test.cfg -description "Molecular Dynamics" \
2hhb_test.cms -mode umbrella -set stage[1].set_family.md.jlaunch_opt=["-gpu"] \
-o 2hhb_test-out.cms -lic "DESMOND_GPGPU:16 -set "stage[1].set_family.md.jlaunch_opt=["\-LOCAL\"]" \
-LOCAL"
```
This is a bit complicated and it's best to write it out from the Maestro GUI as explained above.
Please also have a look at the [additional flags we recommend to use](../support/tutorials/power-maestro.md).

To run such a script in Puhti you first need to initialize Maestro (possibly edit it a bit) and run the script:
```bash
module load maestro
bash your_script_name.sh
```

The following video tutorial walks you through it (although the video was created for Taito, most steps work similarly also for Puhti):

!!! note
    We do not recommend running the Maestro GUI remotely on Puhti.
    It _can_ be done via [NoMachine](nomachine.md), but there are some known glitches
    and the performance is not very good. Also, **no long/heavy tasks** should be
    done on the login nodes. Please consult the
    [policy](../../computing/overview/#usage-policy) on the computing overview.
    If you need to run the GUI on Puhti, use the [sinteractive command](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md).

!!! note
    **Windows** users, you'll need to edit the script created by GUI a little.
    Replace the backslashes "\" with "/" in the path to the Maestro binary
    (right after `$SCHRODINGER` in the script). 

Desmond molecular dynamics runs **very well** on GPUs. We recommend watching 
the video above on how to accomplish this easily.

Maestro gives a warning for using a `schrodinger.hosts` file from your home directory. This is
**not an issue**: that file cannot be made available in the installation directory, so please
ignore that warning, but consider any others you may see.
