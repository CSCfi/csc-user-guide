# Maestro

Schrödinger Maestro is a versatile molecular modelling environment. It has modules
for drug design and Materials Science. It can be used to build, edit, run and analyse 
chemical model systems. Maestro is available for consortium members during 
2019, but will be open to all academic users in 2020.

[TOC]

## Available

Puhti: 2019.3, 2019.4


## License

The Maestro license consists of floating licenses and tokens.
It is possible for one user to take up all licenses for a 
certain module. If licenses run out, contact Atte via Service Desk.

**Consortium**

Until end of 2019 Maestro usage is limited to the Consortium members. 
The current members 
are the groups of Ari Koskinen (Aalto Univ.), Antti Poso (UEF), 
Mark Johnson (ÅA), Petri Pihko (JYU),  Olli Pentikäinen (JYU), 
Henri Xhaard (UH), Tero Aittokallio (UH/FIMM) and Jari Valkonen (UH). 
The licensing is IP-address or local username based. To install 
Maestro locally, the researchers within the consortium should 
contact servicedesk and send new user information. The usage 
is restricted by the 
[EULA](http://www.schrodinger.com/salesagreements/20/7/).

##Usage

It is recommended to download and install Maestro on your 
own computer, see below.

**Local Installation**

Maestro can be installed on a Linux, Mac or Windows computer. 
Download the appropriate files from [www.schrodinger.com](https://www.schrodinger.com/)
You don't need a license to _download_ the software, but you'll need
to configure licensing before you can _run_ it.
Contact Atte via servicedesk@csc.fi for license configuration details.

**Standalone usage on Puhti**

We recommend you to set up your simulations on your local
computer, generate and save the input files, copy them to Puhti and then 
run them from the command line on Puhti. Note, that Maestro jobs
are not run via batch scripts like most other applications at CSC, but
via Schrödinger binaries and a set of flags and options for them.
For example, a Desmond workflow could be run with:

```
"${SCHRODINGER}/utilities/multisim" -JOBNAME 2hhb_test -HOST gputest \
-maxjob 1 -cpu 1 -m 2hhb_test.msj -c 2hhb_test.cfg -description "Molecular Dynamics" \
2hhb_test.cms -mode umbrella -set stage[1].set_family.md.jlaunch_opt=["-gpu"] \
-o 2hhb_test-out.cms -lic "DESMOND_GPGPU:16"

```
This is a bit complicated and it's best to write it out from the Maestro GUI as explained above.

To run such a script in Puhti you first need to initialize Maestro with
 `module load maestro` and then run the script.

The following video tutorial walks you through it (Taito and Puhti work similarly):

!!! note
    We do not recommend running the Maestro GUI remotely on Puhti.
    It _can_ be done via [NoMachine](nomachine.md), but there are some known glitches
    and the performance is not very good. Also, no heavy tasks should be
    done on the login nodes. Please consult the
    [policy on the computing overview.](../computing/overview.md)

Desmond molecular dynamics runs **very well** on GPUs. We recommend watching 
the video above on how to accomplish this easily.

Maestro gives a warning for using a `schrodinger.hosts` file from your home directory. This is
not an issue: that file cannot be made available in the installation directory, so please
ignore that warning, but consider any others you may see.
