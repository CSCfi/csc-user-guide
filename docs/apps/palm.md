## PALM

PALM is an advanced and modern meteorological model system for atmospheric and oceanic boundary-layer flows. It has been developed as a turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulation (LES) model that is especially designed for performing on massively parallel computer architectures. 

The PALM model system has been mainly developed and is maintained by the ​PALM group at the ​[Institute of Meteorology and Climatology (IMUK)](https://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/?&L=1) of Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. A number of code parts have been contributed by national (German) and international work groups. 

## License

The PALM model system is free software. It can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License (v3). 
## Available

At CSC - IT Center for Science PALM is installed on [Puhti and Mahti](../computing/available-systems.md) servers.  Versions available are listed when running the installation script, see below.

## Usage

After login on the server, give command

    module load palm

Link for to read the instruction file is created,

    readme_palm_csc

along with link to the command to run the installation script

    installPalm

It is recommended to read first the instruction file, especially for to get idea of disk partition on the server in where the installation should be done, that is, where to run the installation script.

An example test case input file is included in the installation.  In the instruction file, run commands are given for compilation of the code, and for batch job execution using the example case.   More information about the test case execution, see latest [PALM tutorials](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/tut/palm#Exercisepresentations).
