# NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP)

[NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/)  is a suite of free and open source automated geodesy and stereogrammetry tools designed for processing stereo images captured from satellites (around Earth and other planets), robotic rovers, aerial cameras, and historical images, with and without accurate camera pose information. It produces cartographic products, including digital terrain models (DTMs), ortho-projected images, 3D models, and bundle-adjusted networks of cameras. ASPâ€™s data products are suitable for science analysis, mission planning, and public outreach. 

## Usage

Ames Stereo Pipeline is included in following modules:

* ames-stereo: 3.2.0

Load the module:

```
module load ames-stereo
```

You can test Ames Stereo Pipeline loaded successfully with

```
stereo -help
```

Running `parallel_stereo` can be very computationally expensive, so it should be run via batch jobs system. The software developers recommend reserving full nodes for Ames Stereo Pipeline.




### Exemple batch job

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --output=asp.log
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=40
#SBATCH --mem=50G
#SBATCH --time=5:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --account=project_200XXXX

module load ames-stereo

parallel_stereo [options] <images> [<cameras>] <output_file_prefix>
```

The [parallel_stereo](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/parallel_stereo.html) program is the primary tool of the Ames Stereo Pipeline, it has a lot of different options described in detail in documentation.

Ames Stereo Pipeline supports also multi-node batch jobs, see its [PBS and SLURM documentation](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#using-pbs-and-slurm) for details, notice that in Puhti `--account` should always be given and that correct [`--partion`-names](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md) should be used.
