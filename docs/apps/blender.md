# Blender

Blender is the free, open source 3D creation suite which supports a variety of graphical applications such as 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. 
Advanced users can also use Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools.
