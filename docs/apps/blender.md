# Blender

Blender is a free, open source 3D creation suite which supports a variety of
visualization use cases, such as 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation,
simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and
game creation.

## Available

* Puhti: 3.2, 3.6
* LUMI: 3.5.1

## License

Blender is Free Software. You are free to use Blender for any purpose,
including commercially or for education under Blender's
[GPL license](https://download.blender.org/release/GPL3-license.txt).

## Usage

You need accelerated graphics to work with Blender efficiently.

### Puhti

1. Connect to the [Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/connecting.md).
2. Select the [Accelerated Visualization](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md)
   app of the web interface and specify the required resources.
3. Click the *Launch* button. Your job is placed in the queue, and once it has
   been allocated resources, click *Launch Accelerated Visualization*.
4. Launch Blender from *Applications* > *Visualization* > *Blender* (or search
   for it using the *Application Finder*). Launching the software may take a
   few seconds, so be patient.
