# Bioconda

!!! error "Bioconda has been deprecated!"
    Bioconda is no longer available on Puhti. Native Conda installations sitting
    directly on the shared file system are ineffective and not recommended in HPC
    environments such as Puhti. Please use [Tykky](../computing/containers/tykky.md)
    installations instead to wrap your Conda environment within a container. [See
    a tutorial on this here](../support/tutorials/bioconda-tutorial.md). Note that
    some packages that were previously provided through Bioconda are now available
    as separate modules.
