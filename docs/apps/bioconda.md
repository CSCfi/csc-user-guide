# Bioconda

Native Conda installations are not effective and recommended way to install software to HPC environments like Puhti and Mahti.
Because of that Bioconda module is no longer available in Puhti.

If want to install software using Conda, please use the [Tykky tool](../computing/containers/tykky.md) in stead of Conda.
