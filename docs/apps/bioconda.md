# Bioconda

!!! error "Bioconda has been deprecated!"
    This page is out of date as Bioconda is no longer available on Puhti.
    Native Conda installations sitting directly on the shared file system are
    ineffective and not recommended in HPC environments like Puhti. Please use
    [Tykky](../computing/containers/tykky.md) installations instead to wrap your
    Conda environment within a container. Note that some packages that were
    previously provided through Bioconda are now available as separate modules.
