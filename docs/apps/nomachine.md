!!! warning "NoMachine at CSC discontinued on 25th of May 2023"

    The NoMachine remote desktop service will be discontinued at CSC on 25th May 2023,
    at the end of the current licensing period.


The service is superseded by web interfaces on CSC's supercomputers:

* [Puhti web interface](../computing/webinterface/index.md)
* Similar web interfaces will be opened for both Mahti and LUMI, in the near future.

## Replacements

* For a generic graphical remote desktop, the
[Desktop application](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) can be launched from the web
interface.
* Available as interactive applications.
    * [Jupyter](../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md)
    * [MATLAB](../computing/webinterface/matlab.md)
    * [RStudio](../computing/webinterface/rstudio.md)
    * [TensorBoard](../computing/webinterface/tensorboard.md)
* Some applications are available with GPU acceleration. See
[Accelerated visualization](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md).
* A [login or compute node shell](../computing/webinterface/index.md#shell) can be launched from the web interface.

**If you have difficulties in migrating to use the web interfaces, please don't hesitate to
[contact us](../support/contact.md)!**
