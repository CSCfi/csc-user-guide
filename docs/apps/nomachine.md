# NoMachine

!!! warning "NoMachine at CSC discontinued on 25th of May 2023"

    The NoMachine remote desktop service will be discontinued at CSC on 25th May 2023,
    at the end of the current licensing period.


The service is superseded by web interfaces on CSC's supercomputers:

* [Web interfaces for Puhti and Mahti](../computing/webinterface/index.md)
* Similar web interface will be opened for LUMI in the near future.

## Replacements

* For a generic graphical remote desktop, the
[Desktop application](../computing/webinterface/desktop.md) can be launched from the web
interface.
* For a shell (e.g. a persistent shell on a compute node), have a look at [the shell applications](../computing/webinterface/index.md#shell) on the web interface.
* Available as interactive applications.
    * [Jupyter](../computing/webinterface/jupyter.md)
    * [Julia-Jupyter](../computing/webinterface/julia-on-jupyter.md)
    * [MATLAB](../computing/webinterface/matlab.md)
    * [RStudio](../computing/webinterface/rstudio.md)
    * [TensorBoard](../computing/webinterface/tensorboard.md)
    * [Visual Studio Code](../computing/webinterface/vscode.md)
* Some applications are available with GPU acceleration. See
[Accelerated visualization](../computing/webinterface/accelerated-visualization.md).

**If you have difficulties in migrating to use the web interfaces, please don't hesitate to
[contact us](../support/contact.md)!**
