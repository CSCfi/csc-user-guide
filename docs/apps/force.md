# FORCE 

FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring) is an all-in-one solution for mass-processing medium-resolution satellite images

## Available

__FORCE__ is available in Puhti with the following versions:

* 3.0
* 2.1

## Usage

FORCE is included in the __force__ module. The __parallel__ (gnu-parallel) module needs to be loaded also. You can load these with

`module load parallel force`

By default the latest __force__ module is loaded. If you want a specific version you can specify the version number

`module load parallel force/<VERSION_NUMBER>`

## Using FORCE

FORCE is used with command line commands. All available commands can be viewed by running 

`force`

## Using FORCE to download sentinel images

For downloading files with FORCE you need __ESA Scihub__ or __FMI Finhub__ credentials. FMI Finhub includes only 1C level data for Baltic sea drainage area, but should be faster than ESA Scihub. The credentials should be saved in your __home directory__, the ESA Scihub credentials to __.scihub__ file and FMI Finhub credential to __.finhub__ file. Username in the first row, password second.

The download scripts have been slightly modified for the CSC environment. For ESA Scihub use __force-level1-sentinel2__ command and for FMI Finhub __force-level1-sentinel2-fh__

Here is an example that finds suitable satellite images from an area and time with cloud coverage of 10% and downloads them. More information on Sentinel imagery download can be found from the [FORCE documentation](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/lower-level/level1/level1-sentinel2.html#level1-sentinel2).
