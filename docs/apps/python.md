# Python
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language in CSC's Supercomputers
Puhti and Mahti.

## Available

* Puhti: various 2.x and 3.x versions
* Mahti: various 2.x and 3.x versions
 
System Python is available by default both in Puhti and Mahti without loading
any module. Python 2 (= 2.7.5) is available as `python` (= 2.7.5) Python
3 (= 3.6.8) as `python3`. The default system Python does not include any optional Python
packages. However, you can [install simple packages for yourself by the methods
explained below](python.md#installing-python-packages-to-existing-modules).

In Puhti there are several Python modules available that include different sets
of scientific libraries:

   * python-env - Anaconda Python with conda tools
   * [python-data](python-data.md) - for data analytics and machine learning
   * [MXNet](mxnet.md) - MXNet deep learning framework
   * [PyTorch](pytorch.md) - PyTorch deep learning framework
   * [RAPIDS](rapids.md) - for data analytics and machine learning on GPUs
   * [TensorFlow](tensorflow.md) - TensorFlow deep learning framework
   * [Bioconda](bioconda.md) - conda package manger for installing
     bioinformatics software
   * [BioPython](biopython.md) - biopython and other bioinformatics related
     Python libraries
   * [geoconda](geoconda.md) - for spatial data anlysis 
   * and several other modules may include Python...

In Mahti:

   * python-env - anaconda Python with conda tools
   * python-singularity - Singularity-based Python

To use any of the above mentioned modules, just load the appropriate module, for
example:

```bash
module load python-env
```

Typically, after activating the module, you can continue using the commands
`python` and/or `python3` but these will now point to different versions of
Python with a wider set of Python packages available. For more details, check
the corresponding application documentation (when available).


## Installing Python packages to existing modules

If you find that some package is missing from an existing module, you can often
install it yourself with: `pip install [newPythonPackageName] --user`

The packages are by default installed to your home directory under
`.local/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages` (where `x.y` is the version of Python being
used). If you would like to change the installation folder, for example to make
a project-wide installation instead of a personal one, you need to define the
`PYTHONUSERBASE` environment variable with the new installation local. For
example:

`export PYTHONUSERBASE=/projappl/<your_project>/python3.7_pip`

When later using those libraries you need to remember to add that path to
`PYTHONPATH` or use the same `PYTHONUSERBASE` definition as above. Naturally,
this also applies to slurm job scripts.

Alternatively you can create a separate virtual environment with
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), for example:

```
module load python-data
python -m venv --system-site-packages my-venv
source my-venv/bin/activate
pip install my_package_to_install
```

With `venv`, you can keep separate environments for each program. The next time
you wish to activate the environment you only need to run `source
my-venv/bin/activate`. `venv` does not work with Python modules installed with Singularity.

If you think that some important package should be included in a module provided
by CSC, you can send an email to <servicedesk@csc.fi>.

## Creating your own Python environments
It is also possible to create your own Python environments. The main options are
conda and Singularity. Singularity should be preferred at least when you know of
a suitable ready-made Singularity or Docker container. Conda is easy to use and
flexible, but it might create a huge number of files which is inefficient with
shared file systems. This can cause very slow library imports and in the worst
case slowdowns in the whole file system.

Please, see our Singularity documentation:

   * [Running Singularity containers](../computing/containers/run-existing.md)
   * [Creating Singularity containers](../computing/containers/creating.md),
     including how to convert Docker container to Singularity container.

For Conda:

   * [CSC conda tutorial](../support/tutorials/conda.md) describes in detail
     what conda is and how to use it.
   * [Bioconda](bioconda.md) provides conda tools preinstalled.


## Python development environments

Python code can be edited with a console-based [text editor directly on the
supercomputer](../support/tutorials/env-guide/text-and-image-processing.md).
Codes can also be edited on your local machine and copied to the supercomputer
with [scp](../data/moving/scp.md) or [graphical file transfer
tools](../data/moving/graphical_transfer.md).
You can also [edit Python scripts in Puhti from your local
PC](../support/tutorials/remote-dev.md) with some code editors like Visual
Studio Code.

Finally, several graphical programming environments can be used directly on the
supercomputer, such as Jupyter Notebooks and Spyder.

### Jupyter Notebooks
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) allows one to run Python code via a web browser 
running on a local PC. The notebooks can combine code, equations, visualizations and narrative text
in a single document. Many of our modules, including python-env, python-singularity,
[python-data](python-data.md), the deep learning modules and
[geoconda](geoconda.md) include Jupyter notebook package. See the tutorial
[how to set up and connect to a Jupyter Notebook](../support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md)
for using Jupyter in CSC environment.

### Spyder
[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is scientific Python development
environment. Modules python-env, [python-data](python-data.md) and
[geoconda](geoconda.md) have Spyder included. The best option for using it is
during an [interactive session](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md) with
[NoMachine](../support/tutorials/nomachine-usage.md).

## Python parallel jobs
Python has several different packages for parallel processing:

   * [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
   * [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   * [dask](https://docs.dask.org)
   * [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) - Python interface to MPI 

The `multiprocessing` package is likely the easiest to use and as it is part of the 
Python standard library it is included in all Python installations. `joblib` provides 
some more flexibility. `multiprocessing` and `joblib` are suitable for one 
node (max 40 cores). `dask` is the most versatile and has several options for 
parallelization. Please see [CSC's Dask tutorial](../support/tutorials/dask-python.md) 
which includes both single-node (max 40 cores) and multi-node examples. 

See our GitHub repository for some [examples for using the different
parallelization options with
Puhti](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/puhti).

The `mpi4py` is not included in the current Python environments in CSC supercomputers, 
however, for multinode jobs with non-trivial parallelization it is generally the most 
efficient option. For a short tutorial on `mpi4py` along with other approaches to improve
performance of Python programs see the free online course

Python packages usually are licensed under various free and open source licenses
(FOSS). [Python itself is licensed under the PSF
