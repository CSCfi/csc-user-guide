## ANSYS
ANSYS offers a comprehensive software suite that spans the entire range of physics, providing access to virtually any field of engineering simulation that a design process requires ([ANSYS - Products](https://www.ansys.com/products)). *ANSYS Academic engineering simulation software*  (hereinafter **AAESS**) is used by thousands of universities globally for undergraduate students to learn physics principles, for researchers to solve complex engineering problems and for postgraduate students to produce data for their masterâ€™s theses or doctoral dissertations ([ANSYS - Academic](https://www.ansys.com/academic)).

## License

AAESS products are proprietary software. CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd. has these licences available on CSC's server platforms. The licenses are only for academic use.  See about use limitations from link given below (Ansys Academic - Terms and Conditions), and there, LICENSING AND TERM OF USE.

## Available

CSC's AAESS product licenses are available on CSC's computing platforms [Puhti and Mahti](https://research.csc.fi/csc-s-servers) for analysis runs only. Additionally, on Mahti only CFD modules (Fluent and CFX) are available.  Latest AAESS products will be available on the servers, and earlier versions installation is also possible.  All installed versions are maintained on the servers.  

## Usage

After login on the server, make sure that you have transferred all your input files for the analysis run from your local computer to the server.  Locate the files in your project's scratch directory.  Home directory is not intended for computing.

For to find out which versions of ANSYS are installed on the server, give command

    module available

and check lines *ansys/(version number)*. For example to load Ansys version 19.2., give command

    module load ansys/19.2

There are examples of **batch job files** available on Puhti and Mahti servers:

    Ansys CFX:        /appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_cfx

    Ansys Fluent:     /appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_fluent

    Ansys Structural: /appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_batch_job_files/parjob_struct  (only on Puhti)

Copy those files and modify them for your own use. Further instructions are given in the files.

Ansys Fluent input files for the example batch job are in the folder:
 
    /appl/soft/eng/ansys_inc/example_case_files/aircraft_wing/
    
Notice.  Ansys Structural modules are available only on Puhti server.
