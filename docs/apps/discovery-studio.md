## Usage

To use Discovery Studio you need to install a Discovery
Studio client on your own computer. Discovery Studio client is available for Windows (Windows 7, 8 and 10) and Linux
operating systems (Red hat Enterprise linux 6 and 7, Centos7, or SuSE 11 SP4
recommended). The license provided by CSC is available only 
for university researchers working in Finland. Due to that, your computer must be
within the university network (FUNET) be able to use the 
license.

You can download the Windows and Linux clients using the links below:

In most cases you can just accept the default installation settings that the installation tool suggest.

### Tricks for installing Discovery Studio client to Ubuntu

Below are some tricks you can try to use to install Discovery Studio Client to an Ubuntu Linux machine.  
By default, the _sh_ that Ubuntu is using is actually a command shell called _dash_ that diffters from 
the sh shell that is in use in e.g. Redhat and Centos linuxes. 

In Discovery studio installation this causes problems as the installation process is based on sh scripts.

One way to fix this issue is to redefine sh shell in your Ubuntu server as described e.g. in:

[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/442510/how-to-use-bash-for-sh-in-ubuntu](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/442510/how-to-use-bash-for-sh-in-ubuntu)

Alternatively you can try following:

Start installation with bash shell and _--keep_ option:
```text
bash DS2019Client.bin --keep
```
The installation process fails, but provides a temporary installation directory. Go to this direcory and modify the 
actual installation script a bit and execute the modified version:

```text
cd client/
sed s/"echoe"/"echo -e"/g install_DSClient.sh > install_DSClient_e.sh
bash install_DSClient_e.sh
```
This command does most of the installation but the Lincese Pack installtion fails 
for the same reason as the main instllation process. The fix is also the same:

```text
cd lp_installer/
bash lp_setup_linux.sh --keep
cd lpbuild/
sed s/"echoe"/"echo -e"/g install_lp.sh > install_lp_e.sh
```
Now the installation is done and you just need to add the license data as described in the previous example.
