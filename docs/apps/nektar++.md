## Nektar++

[Nektar++](https://www.nektar.info/) is a tensor product based finite element package designed to allow one to construct efficient classical low polynomial order h-type solvers (where h is the size of the finite element) as well as higher p-order piecewise polynomial order solvers.

The framework comes with a number of solvers and also allows one to construct a variety of new solvers.


The framework currently has the following capabilities:

-   Representation of one, two and three-dimensional fields as a collection of piecewise continuous or discontinuous polynomial domains.
-   Segment, plane and volume domains are permissible, as well as domains representing curves and surfaces (dimensionally-embedded domains).
-   Hybrid shaped elements, i.e triangles and quadrilaterals or tetrahedra, prisms and hexahedra.
-   Both hierarchical and nodal expansion bases.
-   Continuous or discontinuous Galerkin operators.
---Cross platform support for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
