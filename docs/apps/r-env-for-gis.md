You can also install your own additional libraries. Just follow the instructions in the [main R page](r-env-singularity.md).

### GDAL and SAGA GIS support

The `r-env-singularity` module includes the following GDAL and SAGA GIS installations.

`r-env-singularity/3.6.3`:

* [GDAL](gdal.md) 2.4.2 and its commandline tools 
* [SAGA GIS](saga-gis.md) 7.3.0

`r-env-singularity/4.0.2`:

- GDAL 3.2.0 and its commandline tools

- SAGA GIS 7.9.0

### Parallel computing

Some R packages like __raster__ and __spatial.tools__ include functions that support parallel computing. There is an example of using predict function from raster package in parallel among our [examples](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/raster_predict). 

Other than those, you have to parallelize your own R code which can be done with libraries including __snow__ (see the documentation for the [r-env-singularity module](r-env-singularity.md)).

## Interactive usage

It is possible to use RStudio with [an interactive batch job](r-env-singularity.md) on Puhti. The `r-env-singularity` module includes an [RStudio Server](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md#example-rstudio-server-in-sinteractive-session) installation, making it possible to run RStudio from your local browser with a SSH tunnel.

## Using Allas from R

You can use Allas from R with the package __aws.s3__. You can find CSC examples how to use it [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/R/allas/working_with_allas_from_R_S3.R). It is possible to [use files directly](gdal.md#using-files-directly-from-allas) from Allas with libraries like __sf__ and __raster__. With large quantities of data in Allas, virtual rasters should be considered. More information on how to create and use virtual rasters can be found [here.](https://research.csc.fi/virtual_rasters)
