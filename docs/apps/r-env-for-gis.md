You can also install your own additional libraries. Just follow the instructions in the [main R page](r-env-singularity.md).

### GDAL and SAGA GIS support

The `r-env-singularity` module includes the following GDAL and SAGA GIS installations.

| Module name (R version) | GDAL version | SAGA GIS version | 
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | 
| r-env-singularity/3.6.3 |2.4.2         | 7.3.0                 | 
| r-env-singularity/4.0.2 | 3.2.0         | 7.9.0                 | 
| r-env-singularity/4.0.3 | 3.2.0         | 7.9.0                 |   
| r-env-singularity/4.0.4 | 3.2.0		| 7.10.0		       | 
| r-env-singularity/4.0.5 | 3.2.0		| 7.9.0		       | 
| r-env-singularity/4.1.1 | 3.2.2		| 7.9.0		       | 


### Parallel computing

Some R packages like __raster__ and __spatial.tools__ include functions that support parallel computing. There is an example of using predict function from raster package in parallel among our [examples](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/R/raster_predict). 

Other than those, you have to parallelize your own R code which can be done with libraries including __snow__ (see the documentation for the [r-env-singularity module](r-env-singularity.md)).

## Interactive usage

It is possible to use [RStudio with an interactive session](../support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks.md).

## Using Allas from R

You can use Allas from R with the package __aws.s3__. You can find CSC examples how to use it [here](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/blob/master/R/allas/working_with_allas_from_R_S3.R). It is possible to [use files directly](gdal.md#using-files-directly-from-allas) from Allas with libraries like __sf__ and __raster__. With large quantities of data in Allas, virtual rasters should be considered. More information on how to create and use virtual rasters can be found [here.](https://research.csc.fi/virtual_rasters)
