## ArcGIS

### Description

[ArcGIS software] covers a very wide range of sophisticated GIS
(Geographic Information System) tools. It can be used in desktop, server, web
and mobile environments.

CSC organizes ArcGIS software consortium for Finnish universities and
universities of applied sciences. The members of current consortium are
listed at the end of this page. If interested in joining a consortium,
please contact CSC.

ArcGIS may be used for teaching, research or in limited amounts for administrative work. Use for commercial purposes is forbidden. 
Software may be installed to the computers of the consortium member university and computers of personnel 
and students and may be used at home or during field work according to the user terms. The more detailed terms of
use can be found from [ArcGIS site license agreement](../img/ArcGIS_education_Institution_terms_and_conditions_2020-2022.pdf).

### ArcGIS in CSC's computing environment

ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro are not istalled to CSC supercomputers, because these are available
only for Windows. [ArcGIS Python API](geoconda.md) is available in Puhti. ArcGIS Server could be installed to cPouta. 
Some hints for using ArcGIS for heavy computing can be found [here](https://research.csc.fi/arcgis-computing).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ArcGIS for Desktop  and ArcGIS Pro (Advanced, Standard, Basic)

#### Installation:

-   For installation you need **installation package** for the product
    you want to install, ask your University's ArcGIS contact person if
    needed.
-   [Installation guidelines] for ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS for Desktop are
    available in Finnish and English from Esri Finland homepage.
-   **Licensing** options for consortium members (more details below):
    -   Named users, only for ArcGIS Pro and GeoPlanner.
    -   Concurrent licenses from CSC license server, for ArcGIS Pro and
        ArcGIS for Desktop.
    -   Single use licenses, for ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS for Desktop, only
        for personnel.
-   Please install also necessary patches and service packs: [Patches
    and Service Packs for ArcGIS Desktop]

#### Named User licenses

ArcGIS Pro's primary licensing model in "named users", which is
administred in home university's ArcGIS Online, ask you university's
contact person for the license:

1.  Become a member of home university's ArcGIS Online. See guidelines
    below under ArcGIS Online.
2.  Ask for personal license from your university ArcGIS Online
    administrator.  
        -Guideline for the ArcGIS Online administrator: [Guidelines for
    granting ArcGIS licenses in ArcGIS Online].
3.  Install ArcGIS Pro, after installation [log in with
    your personal ArcGIS Online account].

#### Concurrent licenses
    
ArcGIS for Desktop users normally use concurrent licenses from CSC
license server, but there also ArcGIS Pro licenses available.  Ask your
University's ArcGIS contact person for address of the license server and
the port numbers to be opened.

    -Guideline for [using concurrent licenses from ArcGIS Pro]

-   **Attention**! License server is available only from FUNET (Finnish
    Universities) network. When working outside the FUNET network, for
    example at home or field trip, you should first connect to your
    university network (VPN). Or you may borrow the license in advance
    or use Single Use licenses.

#### Borrowing concurrent licenses

ArcGIS Educational site license includes also possibility to borrow
licenses for 100 days. With a borrowed license it is possible to work
without Internet connection or outside of FUNET network.

License is borrowed with [ArcGIS Administrator](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/administer/borrowing-and-returning-licenses.htm) or [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-concurrent-use-license.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_9E03C2B7A83C4FE4A41408EE7E0498CB):

-   Always borrow the base product ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro, only Advanced level is available.
-   All extensions need to be borrowed separately, you are free to
    choose which ones you need. Especially with ArcGIS Pro make sure you borrow all the extensions you need. It is not possible to add extensions to already borrowed base product.
-   Returning of licenses does not work. If returning of licenses does not work, the
    license is returned automatically after 100 days.    
-   In 2018 it has been noticed in some cases that starting ArcMap with
    a borrowed license is slow (2-4 min), but eventually it will start.
    Start up is faster, if the computer does not have any Internet
    connection.
-   Licenses borrowed at the end of year and during first weeks of
    January are also always returned on 30th of January, because annual
    license renewal.

#### Single Use licenses

Single Use licenses are available for university's personnel. These are
especially suitable for people working from distance. Single Use
licenses are always valid until January next year. Single Use licenses
are available from University's contact persons.

### ArcGIS Server, ArcPad, Esri Developer Subscription 

These do not use license server, they need registration code for
installation, these are available from University's contact persons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ArcGIS Online

[ArcGIS Online] is a platform for making and sharing maps, applications
and spatial data. This [ESRI guideline] helps you search data from
ArcGIS Online. Example [videos about using ArcGIS Online] from ESRI.

ArcGIS Online is available for consortium members - each university may have up to 5000 users and use 500 000 ArcGIS
Online -credits per year. The use of credits is described [here].

For joining ArcGIS Online ask your University's ArcGIS contact person.

-   Guideline for the ArcGIS Online administrator: [Invite and add
    members]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Virtual Campus 

Virtual Campus includes a wide selection of Internet courses about GIS,
the focus is on ESRI tools and technology. A lot of Virtual Campus
courses are free, in addition consortium members have access to all
courses of types Web Course or Training seminar.

-   [The full list of Virtual campus courses]

For participating in a Virtual Campus course you need an ESRI Global
Account, if needed you can create it yourself [here][1]. For courses
with a fee, you also need to be added to consortium's ArcGIS accont, ask
for it from CSC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Contact 

-   Each university has its own ArcGIS contact person, for students and personnel she/he
    is the first point of contact.
-   CSC, GIS-coordinator: servicedesk@csc.fi
-   The technical contact person of the consortium member university has
