# QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a free and open source GIS application that can be used for viewing, editing and analysising geospatial data. QGIS supports a very wide range of vector and raster formats and also common API protocols like WMS, WMTS, WCS and WFS.

In Puhti, QGIS could be used for example to visualize the resulting files from other sources (lastools, grass, python)

## Available

__QGIS__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* 3.8.1 Zanzibar via conda

## Usage

### Using QGIS with graphical user interface

QGIS is included in the [geoconda](../apps/geoconda.md) module and can be loaded with

`module load geoconda`

If you are using [NoMachine](nomachine.md) or have connected with a ssh connection that has __X11 forwarding__ enabled, you can launch a graphical user interface with

`qgis`

!!! note
    The recommended way of using graphical interfaces in Puhti is through [NoMachine](nomachine.md) and an [interactive batch job](../computing/running/interactive-usage.md)

It is also possible to access QGIS functionalities from Python without an graphical user interface with the [PyQGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/) library


### QGIS and Allas
QGIS can __read__ files directly from Allas, either using S3 or SWIFT API. Before starting QGIS set up the connection as described in on [GDAL](gdal.md) page.
