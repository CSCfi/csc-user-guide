# QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a free and open source GIS application that can be used for viewing, editing and analysising geospatial data. QGIS supports a very wide range of vector and raster formats and also common API protocols like WMS, WMTS, WCS and WFS.

In Puhti, QGIS could be used for example to visualize the resulting files from other sources (lastools, grass, python)

## Available

__QGIS__ is available in Puhti with following versions:

* 3.8.1 Zanzibar via conda

## Usage

### Using QGIS with graphical user interface

QGIS is included in the [geoconda](../apps/geoconda.md) module and can be loaded with

`module load geoconda`

If you have connected with a ssh connection that has __X11 forwarding__ enabled, you can launch a graphical user interface with

`qgis`


For __X11 forwarding__ to be enabled you need to install a suitable program for your own computer first (unless you are using Linux or Mac). You can read instructions how to do that [here](../computing/connecting.md#using-graphics)


It is also possible to access QGIS functionalities from Python without an graphical user interface with the [PyQGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/) library

!!! note
    Do not run long CPU intensive jobs on the login nodes! This means you can't run computationally intensive analysis on graphical user interfaces on Puhti until interactive Puhti-shells are made available later in 2019. Use the batch job system on Puhti or run analysis on taito-shell.
