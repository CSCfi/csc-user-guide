# Satellite remote sensing

The purpose of this guide is to help you finding the right data and tools for satellite remote sensing tasks. The basis of this guide is a seminar about the topic held at CSC in 2018. And part of the material will also be taught in geospatial training at CSC, check the [training calendar](https://www.csc.fi/web/training) for dates and topics of upcoming courses. The guide provides a shorter summary if you just want to know how to get your processing done quickly (link), and then a more detailed way with lots of information and considerations (link). If you encounter any problems or questions come up, CSC's specialists are happy to help with all aspects of your data driven research, and can be contacted via the [CSC Service Desk](https://www.csc.fi/contact-info).

## Summary

Follow these steps if you 'just want to get the preprocessing done', rather than read the full guide, the TL;DR so to say.

1. Find data 
    * ...
2. Get data
    * ...
3. Process
    * ...
4. Store & Share

## Raster data

* one file per band or multiband files
* grid of pixel values
* example of continuous data
* Georeference: coordinate for the top left pixel in the image, the size of each pixel in the X direction, the size of each pixel in the Y direction, and the amount (if any) by which the image is rotated.

## Using satellite remote sensing data in your research

### What data do I need?

Consider:

* sensor
    * Optical
        * [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
        * [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
        * [Copernicus Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)
        * [Pleiades](https://pleiades.cnes.fr/en/PLEIADES/index.htm)
        * [Spot](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/imagery/constellation/spot/)
        * [Planet](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-imagery/)
        * [WorldView](http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/)
        * and many more...
    * RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) -> SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)
        * [Copernicus Sentinel 1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1)
        * [Radarsat](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/default.asp)
        * [TanDEM-X](https://www.dlr.de/content/en/missions/tandem-x.html)
        * [TerraSAR-X](https://www.dlr.de/content/en/missions/terrasar-x.html)
        * [ICEYE](https://www.iceye.com/)
        * and many more...
    * LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
        * [ICESat](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
        * [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/)
* resolution
    * temporal: when and how often a certain area is visited
    * spatial: the area on the ground that each pixel covers
    * spectral: the area of the electromagnetic spectrum that is observed and spectral width of each band provided
* costs
    * free: e.g. Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel, ...
    * commercial: e.g. WorldView, Spot, Planet, ...
* preprocessing needs
    * raw or pre-processed
* user experience and knowledge
    * RADAR/LiDAR require solid background knowledge for processing and interpretation
    * Optical  data is more easily interpreted and processed (and more pre-processed data is available)


### Where do I find the data?

The best place to get the data from depends on your needs: Do you want to download the data into your own processing environment or do you need a processing environment close to the data? The answer depends on what you want to do with the data and where it is located.

Below is a (uncomplete) set of services, that provide download or download and processing (marked with *) capabilities:

### How can I process the data?

At CSC, EO data can be processed and analyzed using for example supercomputer [Puhti](../../../computing/systems-puhti.md) or a virtual machine in the CSC cloud = [cPouta](../../../cloud/pouta/pouta-what-is.md).

Puhti has software ready installed (internal link to below ), you do not need to worry about it. You can also add your own installations using for example the [Tykky tool](../../../computing/containers/tykky.md). In cPouta, you need to set up your own virtual machine including all security and software setup, see [instructions](../../../cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui.md).

        * Julia 
* user needs
    * batch processing
    * automation
