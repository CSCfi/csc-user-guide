The servers of CSC use Linux operating systems. While the user's local 
computer is normally used mainly through a graphical user interface, 
the remote usage of the servers of CSC is in most cases based on 
working on command line: instead of using mouse and command menus, 
the user types commands to a screen called terminal or console. 
Even though more and more tools provided by CSC can be used through 
graphical interfaces, using the basic linux commands is in many 
cases still the most efficient way.

This tutorial provides an introduction to the usage of the Linux 
environment of CSC. puhti.csc.fi
is used in the examples but the same commands can be used in the 
other servers of CSC, too. If you are using Linux or Mac OSX 
machine, you can also use most of the commands in a terminal 
on your local machine. Once you are familiar with the basic 
Linux commands, you can continue to topics that go deeper 
to the file and data management commands of Linux systems.

The recommended command shell in the CSC computing environment 
is bash, which is also a default. We recommend 
to stick with this choice if no special reason for another flavour 
is given.

This guide is accurate for bash shell only. If you are using 
some other Linux command shell, e.g. tcsh, some 
instructions/details may not apply or work.
