# Packing and compression tools

When large data sets are stored at CSC or transported over the net it is
usually reasonable to *archive* (i.e., pack multiple files into a single
file) and *compress* (i.e., reduce its size without losing any data) the
data. Archiving makes file transfer easier while compressed files
require less storage space and are thus faster to move from one system
to another. In this chapter we will provide introduction
to [tar], [gzip], [bzip2], [zip], [7zip] and [Zstandard] tools that are
frequently used for archiving and compression.

| Type                           | Extension                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| A zip archive                  | .zip, .ZIP, or .Z                 |
| A gzip compressed file         | .gz                               |
| A bzip2 compressed file        | .bz2, or .bz                      |
| A tar archive                  | .tar                              |
| A gzip compressed tar archive  | .tar.gz, or .tgz                  |
| A bzip2 compressed tar archive | .tar.bz2, .tar.bz, .tbz, or .tbz2 |
| A 7zip compressed file         | .7z                               |
| A Zstandard compressed file    | .zst                              |

## Tar: packing several files into one file

**tar** is a computer software utility for collecting many files into
one archive file, often referred to as a *tarball*, for distribution or
backup purposes. The name is derived from **t**ape **ar**chive, as it
was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no
file system of their own. However, nowadays tar – and its GNU
version, **gtar** – are mostly used for data archiving within a normal
disk environment. The archive files created by tar contain various file
system parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access
permissions, and directory structures, which makes moving and storing
large file sets easier that trying to manage separate files.

By default, tar does not compress the data. This means that the size of
the tar archive file is the same as the sum of the sizes of packed
files, plus some overhead metadata. If data compression is needed, you
can use compression tools like [gzip] or [bzip2] with *tar*.

*tar* and *gtar* are compatible with each other; if you archive your
data with *tar* you can unarchive it with *gtar* and vice versa.
Normally *tar* and/or *gtar* can be found from any Unix, Linux or Mac OS
X system. In Windows systems you can use for example **7zip** program to
manage tar archive files.

The syntax of a tar command is:

```bash
tar options tar_archive file …
```

For example, we may have a directory called *project\_3*, which contains
nine files called *sample1.txt*, *sample2.txt*, …, *sample9.txt*. To
list the contents of the directory we could use the command **ls -lh**:

~~~~
$ ls -lh project_3
total 53M
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  16M Nov  9 10:41 sample1.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  16M Nov  9 10:41 sample2.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.3M Nov  9 10:41 sample3.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.9M Nov  9 10:41 sample4.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.9M Nov  9 10:41 sample5.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.7M Nov  9 10:42 sample6.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 4.0M Nov  9 10:42 sample7.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.9M Nov  9 10:42 sample8.txt
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 3.9M Nov  9 10:42 sample9.txt
~~~~

We can archive all the files in the project\_3 directory to a tar
archive called  *project\_3.tar* with tar's create (c) command:

~~~~
$ tar cvf project_3.tar project_3
~~~~

The command above creates a new tar archive file, project\_3.tar, which
contains the directory project\_3 and all the files in it. Note that the
command does not modify or remove the original files in the source
directory:

~~~~
$ ls -lh
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 testuser csc   11 Nov  9 10:44 project_3
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  52M Nov  9 10:46 project_3.tar
~~~~

The *tar* command does not require that you assign a certain extension,
like *.tar*, for your archive files. However, applying commonly used
file name extensions will help you and other users to select right
commands for processing the file later on. The newly created tar archive
file can now be easily moved to another directory or system and then
unarchived with the extract (x) command:

~~~~
$ tar xvf project_3.tar
~~~~

This command will create a directory called *project\_3*, which contains
all the same files as the original directory did. Note that if the
extract command encounters a file that already exists in the file
system, the existing file will be overwritten by the extracted file.
This causes a potential danger: possibly a newer version of a file will
be lost if an older version of the same file (or, just a file with a
same name) exists in the tar archive that is being unarchived!

| Command  | Operation                                                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A        | Append tar files to an archive (i.e. concatenate archive files)        |
| c        | Create a new tar archive                                               |
| d        | Find differences between an archive and the file system                |
| r        | Append files at the end of an archive                                  |
| t        | List the contents of an archive                                        |
| u        | Only append files that are newer than the existing ones in the archive |
| x        | Extract files from an archive                                          |
| --delete | Delete files from the archive                                          |

In addition to the commands above, the option **f** (file) is almost
always used as it defines the name of the tar file to read from or to
write to. The file name must follow right after the option, thus it is
commonly the last option given. Below are some frequently used tar
options.

| Option | Function                                                                    |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| f      | Use the given file name as the source or target archive                     |
| v      | Be verbose, i.e. list processed files to the screen while processing        |
| z      | Use gzip compression/decompression while creating or extracting an archive  |
| j      | Use bzip2 compression/decompression while creating or extracting an archive |

With options **z**ip or **j** (no meaning, it was chosen because no
meaningful letter were available) you can filter the archive
through [gzip] or [bzip2] respectively to (de)compress the archive on
the fly:

~~~~
$ tar cvzf project_3.tar.gz project_3
~~~~

Here, in this sample case, the size of the uncompressed archive file is
52 MB but the compressed file is only 15 MB.

~~~~
$ ls -lh
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 testuser csc   11 Nov  9 10:44 project_3
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  52M Nov  9 10:46 project_3.tar
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc  15M Nov  9 10:56 project_3.tar.gz
~~~~

Listing the contents of a tar archive file can be done with command
lis**t**:

~~~~
$ tar tf project_3.tar
project_3/
project_3/sample3.txt
project_3/sample4.txt
project_3/sample5.txt
project_3/sample2.txt
project_3/sample1.txt
project_3/sample6.txt
project_3/sample8.txt
project_3/sample9.txt
project_3/sample7.txt
~~~~

You can also retrieve just one file from the archive by specifying the
full file name to the data extraction command. For example, to extract
just file sample2.txt from the compressed archive project\_3.tar.gz we
could use command:

~~~~
$ tar xvzf project_3.tar.gz project_3/sample2.txt
~~~~

# Compressing files 

Compressing files saves storage space and makes data trasport faster,
but it may take a lot of time. Data compression is CPU intensive and
compressing a data set of several terabytes can easily require overnight
computing.

There are numerous algorithms and software tools available for data
compression. Here we will briefly show five tools that are used in
Unix/Linux systems: *gzip*, *bzip2*, *zip, 7z and Zstandard*. What is
common to all these tools is that they do the compression without data
loss, i.e. when the files are uncompressed the data will be 100%
identical to the original data. Typically, a text file compressed with
one of these tools is about 20-40% of the size of the original file.
However, the compressibility of a file depends heavily on the content of
the file.

The compression time depends on the algorithm used and the type of data
to be compressed. In most cases the newer Zstandard method is
significantly faster than the older, but very widely used methods like
gzip or zip.  The table below shows results for one sample case,
were 10GB text file (fastq formatted sequence data) was compressed with
these five methods in the Puhti supercluster.

## gzip and gunzip 

**gzip** is probably the most commonly used packing tool in Unix and
Linux systems. It uses the *Lempel-Ziv coding* (LZ77) for compressing
the data. *gzip* was already briefly mentioned in the *[tar]* chapter
above, but gzip can also be used as a totally separate tool. The normal
usage of *gzip* is straight forward. To compress a file you give the
command:

~~~~
$ gzip file_name
~~~~

Running this command creates a compressed file and names it using the
original file name with an extension *.gz*. When the compression is
ready the original file is removed. If you want to preserve the original
file, you need to use redirection, like:

~~~~
$ gzip < file_name > file_name.gz
~~~~

Decompressing a gzipped file is done with command **gunzip**. In
addition to gzip compressed files, gunzip can also decompress  files
compressed with [zip] command. The basic syntax of gunzip is analogous
to the compressing command:

~~~~
$ gunzip file_name.gz
~~~~

The command above removes the compressed file when decompression is
ready. If you wish the keep the compressed file, you'll need redirection
again:

~~~~
$ gunzip < file_name.gz > file_name
~~~~

gzip has several command line options that are not discussed here. Use
 **man gzip**  command to see the full list of available options. Also,
note that gunzip command is actually just a wrapper for the *gzip
-d* command (option *-d* instructs gzip to decompress, rather than
compress) so you will not find a separate manual page for that.

### gzip example 

Lets assume we are in the $WRKDIR directory of Puhti-shell and there we
have just one file called *my\_data.dat*. Lets first check the size of
that file with command **ls -lh**:

~~~~
$ ls -lh
total 1.5G
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.5G Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat
~~~~

The listing tells us that the size of the file is approximately 1,5 GB.
Next, we compress the file with gzip and then check the file size again.

~~~~
$ gzip my_data.dat
$ ls -lh
total 834M
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 833M Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat.gz 
~~~~

The original file has now been removed and been replaced by the
compressed file. However, as a result we now have a compressed file that
requires only 833MB of disk space (55% of the original size). Next we
decompress the file:

~~~~
$ gunzip my_data.dat.gz
$ ls -lh
total 1.5G
-rw-r--r--+ 1 testuser csc 1.5G Nov  4 13:07 my_data.dat 
~~~~

The file listing now shows that the compressed file has disappeared and
the original file is available again.

## bzip2 and bunzip2 

**bzip2** is a compression program that is used very similarly compared
to [gzip][bzip2]. The main difference between the two programs is that
bzip2 uses *Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression
algorithm* combined with *Huffman coding* instead of the LZ77 algorithm
used in gzip. The compression algorithm of bzip2 produces more effective
compression than gzip's. However, computing the bzip2 compression
usually is more complex and takes longer (i.e., uses more CPU cycles)
than gzip compression. The usage of bzip2 is very similar to that of
gzip, but not all the command line options are  identical. The basic
compression syntax is:

~~~~
$ bzip2 file_name
$ bzip2 < file_name > file_name.bz2
~~~~

Similarly, the decompression can be done with command:

~~~~
$ bunzip2 file_name.bz2
$ bunzip2 < file_name.bz2 > file_name
~~~~

Note that a file compressed with bzip2 can not be uncompressed with
gunzip and vice versa.

In addition to the standard bzip2 and bunzip2 programs, you can also use
the parallel versions of bzip2
command: [][6]**pbzip2** and [][7]**pbunzip2**. When these commands are
used, the user must use option *-p* to define the number of processor
cores to be used. For example, compressing the file my\_data.dat using
four cores can be done with command:

~~~~
$ pbzip2 -p4 my_data.dat
~~~~

Similarly, to decompress the file with two cores you can use command:

~~~~
$ punbzip2 -p2 my_data.dat.bz2
~~~~

The pbzip2 and pbunzip2 commands scale well for small core numbers.
Already with two cores the pbzip2 is about as fast as gzip. The number
of processors used does not affect to the actual result file. Thus, a
file that has been compressed with parallel pbzip2 can be uncompressed
with normal bunzip2 command and vice versa.

## zip and  unzip: the combined compression and file archiving tool

The **zip** program can be used for both archiving and compressing
files. Given a list of files or a directories the zip command archives
and compresses all the files in to a single zip archive file. So, in
principle zip is analogous to the combination of [tar] and [gzip]
commands. Later on the whole archive, or just certain files, can be
extracted from the archive. The basic syntax of zip command is:

~~~~
$ zip -options archive_file source_name
~~~~

The *source\_name* can be a list of files, directories, or a combination
of both, that will be packed in to the *archive\_file*. If the
archive\_file already exists, zip will replace the existing files in the
archive with new ones from the source\_name list, or add files if they
do not exist in the archive\_file yet. Note that unlike the tar command,
zip does not add any files from subdirectories in to the archive by
default. The option *-r* is needed to recursively add all files and
subfolders from a given directory to the zip archive. Below is listed
some commonly used zip command options.

| Option | Function                                                                                                                                        |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -d     | Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive                                                                                                      |
| -e     | Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a  password  which is  entered  on  the terminal in response to a prompt                          |
| -f     | Replace  (freshen)  an existing file in the zip archive only if it has been modified more recently than the version  already in the zip archive |
| -l     | Translate  the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS convention CR LF                                                                    |
| -ll    | Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF                                                                                              |
| -r     | Travel the directory structure recursively                                                                                                      |
| -u     | Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files                                                                           |
| -@     | Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one filename per line.                                                                   |

   
Creating a zip archive does not affect the original files. Note that the
zip command will add the *.zip* extension to the archive file name by
default, if it is not already included.

Zip archives can be extracted and studied with the **unzip** command. To
extract files from a zip archive, use the command:

~~~~
$ unzip archive_file_name
~~~~

To just see the files included in the zip archive use command:

~~~~
$ unzip -l archive_file_name
~~~~

You can also extract just one file from an archive with command:

~~~~
$ unzip archive_file_name file_name
~~~~

| Option        | Function                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -f            | Freshen existing files, i.e., extract only those files that already exist on disk and  are newer than the ones on the disk |
| -l            | List the content of an archive file                                                                                        |
| -u            | Update existing files and create new ones if needed                                                                        |
| -o            | Overwrite existing files without prompting                                                                                 |
| -p *password* | Use *password* to decrypt an encrypted zip file                                                                            |



### zip example

To archive and compress the sample directory *project\_3*, which
contains the files *sample1.txt*, *sample2.txt*, …, *sample9.txt* (the
same example that was used in the tar chapter) use the command:

~~~~
$ zip -r project_3.zip project_3
  adding: project_3/ (stored 0%)
  adding: project_3/sample5.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample2.txt (deflated 72%)
  adding: project_3/sample3.txt (deflated 70%)
  adding: project_3/sample4.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample9.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample7.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample1.txt (deflated 73%)
  adding: project_3/sample6.txt (deflated 72%)
  adding: project_3/sample8.txt (deflated 71%)
~~~~

Note that if you use the same zip command without the *-r* option, the
archive file will not include the sample files in the directory but just
the directory. However, in this case the project\_3 directory does not
include any subdirectories, so you could also do archiving with command:

~~~~
$ zip project_3.zip project_3/*
  adding: project_3/sample1.txt (deflated 73%)
  adding: project_3/sample2.txt (deflated 72%)
  adding: project_3/sample3.txt (deflated 70%)
  adding: project_3/sample4.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample5.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample6.txt (deflated 72%)
  adding: project_3/sample7.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample8.txt (deflated 71%)
  adding: project_3/sample9.txt (deflated 71%)
~~~~

In the same way, you can later add a new file to an existing zip
archive, e.g.:

~~~~
$ cp sample10.txt project_3/
$ zip project_3.zip project_3/sample10.txt
 adding: project_3/sample10.txt (deflated 69%)
~~~~

You can check the contents of the zip archive with unzip and
option *-l* (small letter L):

~~~~
$ unzip -l project_3.zip
Archive:  project_3.zip

## 7zip packing and compression tool 

7zip is a packing and compression tools that is frequently
used especially in Windows platforms. It can be however used in Max OSA
and Linux systems too. By default the command uses its own *7z*
compression file format but it can utilize other compression file
formats too.

In Puhti *7zip* is launced with command **7z**. The syntax of the
command is

    7z command -options archive_file file_names

The most important 7zip commands are:

-   **a** Add files to an archive
-   **e** extract files from an archive file
-   **l** list files in the archive file

To archive and compress the sample directory *project\_3*, which
contains the files s*ample1.txt*, *sample2.txt*, …, *sample9.txt* (the
same example that was used in the tar chapter) use the command:

    $ 7z a project_3_backup project_3/

    Everything is Ok

This created an new 7z-compressed file: project\_3\_backup.7z. The 7z a
command can also be used to add a new file existing archive. Foe example
if we would get a new sample file called sample10.txt to the project\_3
directory, we could add it to the previously created
project\_3\_backup.7z file with command:

    7z a project_3_backup project_3/sample10.txt

You can list the content of this file with 7z l command. For example

 

     $ 7z l project_3_backup.7z

Compressed data is extracted with command: 7z e. You can extract just
the defined files, fore example:

    7z e project_3_backup.7z project_3/sample3.txt

Note that if you choose to download just individual files: 1. You must
use the full file path that is given in the file listing and 2. the
specified compressed file is downloaded to the current directory and not
to a directory path defined in the compressed file name. Thus the above
command would return a file sample3.txt to the directory where the
command was executed.

The output directory for the extracted files can be defined with option
**-o**. For example to retrieve all the compressed files to directory
*project\_3*, you should give command:

    7z e -oproject_3 project_3_backup.7z

 

## Zstandard compression tool

*Zstandard* is a fairly new and very fast compression tool. In Puhti,
Zstandard compression can be done with command **zstdmt**. For
example, to compress file *data.txt* give command:

    zstdmt data.txt

The above command produces a compressed file named as *data.txt.zst.*
For larger datafiles you can speed up the compression by using multiple
computing cores (threads). The number of threads is defined with option
*-T.* In the login nodes of Puhti it is recommended that you use just
one thread that is the defult setting, but for example in puhti-shell
you can use four threads:

    zstdmt -T 4 data.txt

Decompression is defined by adding  option  *-d * to the command:

    zstdmt  -d data.txt.zst
