# Puhti RHEL8 test system documentation

## RHEL8 login nodes

There's one virtualized login node available for RHEL8 testing,
`puhti-login12`. This new test node has same `/users`, `/scratch` and
`/projappl` folders as current production setup, so you can test your
current installations easily.

!!! Note
    These test system nodes share the same home folder with the
    current production environment. So all settings that you have in
    your normal login scripts and environment are visible and active
    on RHEL8 nodes too. Please make sure that you clean your `.bashrc`
    and other relevant files before logging in.

!!! Note
    Lmod caches module information into your home folder under
    `~/.lmod.d/.cache` and may give you wrong listing of modules when
    working on both RHEL7 and RHEL8 nodes. Please use `--ignore-cache`
    option on module commands or clean the cache folder when
    necessary.

## CPU and GPU nodes with RHEL8

New OS can be tested on two partitions, `rhel8-cpu` and `rhel8-gpu`,
which have 10 and 2 respectively.
