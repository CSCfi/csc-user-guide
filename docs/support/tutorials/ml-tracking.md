# Managing machine learning workflows on CSC's supercomputers

This guide discusses various ways for managing your machine learning
workflows on CSC's supercomputers. It is part of our [Machine learning
guide](ml-guide.md).


Instead of providing a single integrated machine learning workflow
system, our approach is to support a wide range of ML workflow tools
so that users can pick what fit their needs best. This approach tends
to work best for research users who have very heterogenous computing
needs.

## MLflow

[MLflow][MLflow] is an open source tool for tracking experiments and
models in machine learning projects.
