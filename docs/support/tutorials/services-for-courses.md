# CSC Services for Courses

This guide will explain how to use the course project type with CSC's
high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud services.

## Prerequisites

Staff members from higher education institutions and state research institutes can create a MyCSC course project. What you will need is:

   1. [A CSC account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md)
   2. [A MyCSC course project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md)
   3. [A Service activated](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md)

## Available services

The following services are available to support you in delivering your course. All services except Noppe require an active MyCSC project with the relevant service enabled. Applying for more quota depends on the services; see the details below. The medium (M) billing unit package is the default package granted for course projects. This should cover most use cases.

The services are listed in alphabetical order.
