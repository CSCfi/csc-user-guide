# Blender tutorials

These tutorial videos teach you how to use [Blender software](../../apps/blender.md)
for scientific visualization. The series focuses on features useful for scientists, and
correspond to one full day hands-on course. Note that the videos have caption texts,
which you can switch on in YouTube (the "CC" button in the right bottom corner of the
video). These videos were created by Jyrki Hokkanen in late 2020. Materials for hands-on
exercises can be downloaded from Allas (the links are provided in the sections below).
