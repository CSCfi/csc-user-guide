# Getting started with the Student Project

This tutorial contains all the information you need to get started with student projects. Please read this page carefully!

## tl;dr

1. You are the manager of [the project](student_quick.md#introduction).
	1. So you are also responsible for what happens in the project. Don't be a jerk.
2. You choose [the other people](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md) in your project.
	1. Or choose none. Because you're responsible for these guys too.
3. You decide which [services](student_quick.md#adding-services-to-your-project) are available.
4. All [BU:s](student_quick.md#resources-and-limitations) are yours to use.
5. [Have fun!](student_quick.md#using-the-services)
