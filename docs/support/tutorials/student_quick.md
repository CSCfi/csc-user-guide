# Getting started with the Student Project

This tutorial contains all the information you need to get started with using CSC services. Please read this page carefully!

## Student Project

Student project is access to **a fixed amount of resources** for **a fixed period of time** for selected CSC services.

Its purpose is to help students with their studies **free of charge**[^1].

The services are provided through **the same infrastructure** used by researchers, teachers and other students at Finnish higher education institutions.[^2]

So - please **be mindful** of your use of resources. Respect infrastructure and other users.[^3]

## Project Manager

Thanks to our updated terms and conditions, you - the student - can now be **the project manager** of the student project.

You will have **the same responsibilities** as any other CSC Project Manager.[^4]

As a project manager, you can **invite people** to your project[^5]. _(but you're also responsible for their actions in the project)_

## Services of The Project

The following services can be activated:

- [Allas](../../data/Allas/index.md){:target="_blank"} storage service

Below's the life cycle of a student project:

1. [Create a new user account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-with-haka-or-virtu) _(done once at first login)_
2. [Create a student project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md#student)
3. [Add members to your project](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md) _(optional)_
4. [Add access to services](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md)
5. Use the services. Instructions vary depending on the service.
6. Manage your data across multiple services and plan to **back it up** before the project ends.
