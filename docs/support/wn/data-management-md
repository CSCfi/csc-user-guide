## How do I add an entry to the "What's new" section

A good way to highlight a new update is to add an entry to the What's new -section. Follow these steps:

1. **Do not** edit the `index.md` landing page or `whats-new.md` files. Instead go to `docs/support/wn/` and edit the file which applies best for your update
    * `apps-new.md` = New installed software or updated version
    * `comp-new.md` = Updates to the computing environment, e.g. SLURM updates, new/deprecated libraries, web interface..
    * `training-new.md` = New/updated tutorials or training materials published
    * If these categories do not match your update, you can add a new file with similar structure as the above ones. It is also a good idea to consult #docs.csc.fi RC channel first.
2. At the top of the file, add a new level 2 heading (##) for your update including a descriptive title followed by the current date.
   * For example, `## SoftwareX v1.2.3 installed on Puhti, 31.3.2022`
3. Under this heading, describe the update with a few sentences. Include links to appropriate pages elsewhere in docs, as well as external links to e.g. release notes/changelog if applicable.
4. Commit your changes and when the PR gets merged a script will automatically add your updates to the docs landing page.
