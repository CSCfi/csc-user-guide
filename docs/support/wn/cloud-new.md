## CSC Notebooks runs version R5 of Pebbles software, 5.10.2022

As of 2022, CSC Notebooks runs version R5 of Pebbles software. Compared to R4:

* User interface has similar functionality but is greatly improved.
* Environments/blueprints are now called applications.
* Applications are arranged in workspaces. Workspaces are closely related to groups in the previous version, but come with additional features. Workspaces also have lifetime.
* Workspaces have a shared folder for sharing files with members.
* Workspace members also have a dedicated my-work folder to save their course work between sessions.
