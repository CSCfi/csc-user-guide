## Python Data 3.9, 22.6.2021

A new version of [Python Data](../../apps/python-data.md) is now available with
`module load python-data/3.9-1`. It includes the most recent versions of
Scikit-learn, Pandas, JupyterLab and many other popular data analytics and
machine learning packages for Python 3.9.

This is the first version of Python Data that has been installed using
Singularity which should make loading times much faster. Thanks to wrapper
scripts this change should be mostly invisible to users. If you still encounter
any problems, don't hesitate to report them to [CSC's service
desk](../contact.md).
