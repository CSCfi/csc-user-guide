## Sensitive Data services for research 30.3.2022

Our Sensitive Data services guide has been updated and reorganised into the following sections:

* [Introduction to the services and legal agreements](../../data/sensitive-data/intro.md#introduction);

* [Sensitive Data Connect](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_connect.md#), with a specific paragraph describing [data encryption compatible with Sensitive Data services](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_connect.md#introduction-to-data-encryption-compatible-with-sensitive-data-services);

* [Sensitive Data Desktop](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#), with a specific section dedicated to [software customisation with singularity containers](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#software-customisation);

* [general FAQs about the services](../../support/faq/index.md#sensitive-data-services-for-research).

During the last service break, we also enabled new features:

* [**automated encryption**](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_connect.md#sensitive-data-encryption-and-upload-less-than-100-gb) during data upload via SD Connect (user interface, less than 100 GB);

* [**authorised data export**](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#data-export-from-sd-desktop) from SD Desktop using the airlock client.
