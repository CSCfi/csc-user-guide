## Techincal issues on SD Connect: follow up 02.2023

Files uploaded using the SD Connect automated encryption option between November 2, 2022, and December 20, 2022, might be corrupted. This is because during the upload phase, files are split into short segments, and in some cases, due to a technical issue, the correct segment's order has been lost, making the files unreadable. Therefore, if you have used this function, we advise you to upload a new copy of the files. If this is impossible, don't hesitate to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi. 

We will evaluate individual cases to determine if the files can be retrieved. Currently, SD Connect automated encryption is supported only for files < 1GB. 
Larger files can be encrypted following this workflow:

* [Sensitive data encryption and upload for analysis, up to 100 GB](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_connect.md#sensitive-data-encryption-and-upload-for-analysis-up-to-100-gb)
* [Command Line Interface: data encryption and upload](../..data/sensitive-data/sd_connect.md#command-line-interface-data-encryption-and-upload)


## Sensitive Data services now have an audited computing environment for secondary use of social and health data 8.6.2022

SD Desktop is a certified environment for data processing under the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data. However, the services provided for this purpose have specific limitations compared to the standard service.

For more information see the user guide:

* [SD Desktop for secondary use](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-audited.md) and [Accessing SD service](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-access.md) explaining how to apply access to the audited SD Desktop service and describing the use and limitations of the audited environment.
