# Audited SD Desktop for registry data

## What is the audited SD Desktop environment for?

The audited SD Desktop is for analyzing secondary use health and social data, more specifically Findata controlled registry data. SD Desktop has been audited against the Findata regulation.

## How does processing secondary use data on SD Desktop differ from standard use of Sensitive Data services?

With registry data, there are some restrictions to the service compared to the standard use of SD Desktop because of the data authority’s requirements for a secondary use environment. Most important limitations include: the CSC project will be managed by CSC instead of the user and other services are not available. Read more in SD Desktop service description.

## How can I access my registry dataset with SD Desktop?

First, you need to have a data permit from Findata. Then you need to request for a CSC project from our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) with the data permit and create a CSC account if you do not have one already. The data will be transported directly to the service from Findata and available only for verified project members on the virtual Desktop. You can access the virtual Desktops on [the SD Desktop service page](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi/).

## Can I combine my own data with secondary use registry data on SD Desktop?

In a project using secondary use registry data, all the data processed on SD Desktop must come from Findata. If you want to combine your own data with registry data, you need to ask Findata to do that for you.

## Is it possible to install software to SD Desktop when processing secondary use data?

The programs available on the Desktop are [listed in the user guide](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#default-programs-available-on-sd-desktop). Only Findata can provide the necessary files to CSC where you can access them on your Desktop when processing their registry data. If the software you need is not pre-installed on the Desktop, you need to 1) contact our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) to check if the program is compatible with the Desktop, and 2) request Findata to import the files to your Desktop.

## How can I export my results from the audited Desktop?

You need to make a request to our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) to export your results. The results will be exported directly to Findata and you will receive them after the authority’s scrutiny.

## What will happen to my data after the secondary use data permit expires?

You will not be able to access your virtual Desktop after the validity period of your data permit ends. If you do not send an amendment application to Findata and request us to extend the duration of your project, you will be removed from the CSC project and the project will be considered inactive. The project and all the data will be deleted after 90 days, according to CSC’s data retention policy. You need to have all your results exported from the Desktop before the data permit expires – you cannot access them when the permit is no longer valid.
