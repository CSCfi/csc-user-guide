# I cannot login. What to do?

The first thing to do when you encounter login problems is to find out which services you can login and which you cannot.

## I can login to MyCSC but not the system I want to use

If you can login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi), there are two common reasons for
login problems affecting other services:

1. The service you are trying to login is down or has issues. See notifications
in your mailbox or at [research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi). Wait until the
maintenance is completed or the issue is resolved.
2. Your project does not have access to the service that you are trying to
login, or the access has expired. Check the services linked to your projects at
MyCSC. You may need to [add service access for your
project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) or [create new
project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md).

others:

You need to contact us to get your account unlocked. Our email address is
