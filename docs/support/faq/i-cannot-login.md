# I cannot login. What to do?

The first thing to do when you encounter login problems is to find out which services you can login and which you cannot.

## I can login to MyCSC but not the system I want to use

If you can login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi), there are two common reasons for
login problems affecting other services:

1. The service you are trying to login is down or has issues. See notifications
in your mailbox or at [research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi). Wait until the
maintenance is completed or the issue is resolved.
1. Your project does not have access to the service that you are trying to
login, or the access has expired. Check the services linked to your projects at
MyCSC. You may want to [add service access for your
project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) or [create a new
project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md).

## I cannot login to MyCSC

If you cannot login to MyCSC, there is one problem that is more common than
others:

1. Your account is locked. The most common reasons are:

    * You have not changed your password for a year.
    * We have sent email to you but it bounces back.
    * Your account was granted for a fixed period and the time is up.

You need to contact us to get your account unlocked. Our email address is
