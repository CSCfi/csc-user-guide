# What to do for data in Allas after project ends?

The Allas object storage is meant to host data only for the lifetime of a
project. After the project ends, you have several options where to move your
data:

1. You can
   [move the data to a new CSC project](./is-it-possible-to-move-data-in-allas-to-new-project.md).
2. You can archive the data in a long-term data storage. Some services you
   might want to consider are:
    1. [IDA](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/){target="_blank"}
    2. [CSC data management and storage services](https://research.csc.fi/data-management){target="_blank"}
    3. [DPS](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/dps-for-research-data/){target="_blank"}
3. You can download the data to yourself. Make sure you have enough space to
   store the data locally, or make use of your own organization's storage
   systems.
4. Delete the data (in case you are sure you do not need it anymore).
