# I cannot login to CSC computing environment even though I know that my username and password are correctly typed. What is wrong?

It is possible that you have exceeded you disk space limit and login is not possible anymore. Contact ServiceDesk and explain the symptoms. If the issue is disk space limit, you'll get some temporary disk space to clean up your home directory.
