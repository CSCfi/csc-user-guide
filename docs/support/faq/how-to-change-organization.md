# I have moved to a new university/organization. Can I keep my present user account and join it to some new project under the new organization?

Yes, you can. Doing this is actually mandatory so that the user statistics will
go right, and so that your account will not be closed when your old email
address expires.

[Please contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md), and we will update your
organization for you. After this, you may
[apply for a new project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md), or your
project manager in the new organization can
[add you to the relevant project(s)](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md).
