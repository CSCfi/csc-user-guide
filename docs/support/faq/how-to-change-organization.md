#I have moved to a new university/organization. Can I keep my present user account and join it to some new project under the new organization?

Yes, you can, and the move is actually obligatory so that the user statistics will go right, and your account won't get closed when your old e-mail address expires.

E-mail us, and we will change the organization. After this, your project manager in the new organization can [add you to the relevant project(s)](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md), or [apply for a new project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md).
