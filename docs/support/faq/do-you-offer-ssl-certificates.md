# Do you offer SSL certificates?

Not as such, but you do have several options:

* If your organization is a Funet member organization, and it has
  signed the contract to use the certificate service, you can get free
  certificates via your organization's administrators.
* There are also services that provide free certificates. For example,
  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provides certificates which behave
  well with most modern web browsers.
* If you are using Rahti 2, you can use the wildcard certificate for
  `*.2.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names. See also:
