#  Do you offer SSL certificates?

Not as such, but you do have several options:

* if your organization is a Funet member organization and it has signed the contract to use the certificate service, you can get free certificates via your organization's DigiCert administrators. The service is located in [https://www.digicert.com/account](https://www.digicert.com/account) and instructions (in Finnish only) on how to use the service can be found from [here](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/x/FIFpAQ). This service is the renewed Funet certificate service, [https://varmennepalvelu.funet.fi/](https://varmennepalvelu.funet.fi/).
* there are also services that provide free certificates. For example Let's Encrypt, available in [https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/), provides certificates which behave well with most modern web browsers.
