# I am leaving abroad as a visiting scientist or a post doc researcher. May I use CSCâ€™s computing resources during my visit abroad?

You have the right to use CSC's computers if the connection to the Finnish home university remains. If you have problems using computers abroad, contact Service Desk to locate the problem.
