# I cannot login to Puhti from NoMachine.

The problem is likely your keyboard mapping in the remote desktop. Don't try too many times, or your account will be (temporarily) banned.

To fix this, please consult the known issues section in the [CSC NoMachine Tutorial](../tutorials/nomachine-usage.md)

!!! Note
    To run remote graphics on CSC servers, we now recommend you to primarily use the [Puhti web interface remote desktop](../../computing/webinterface/desktop.md). Usage of NoMachine to connect to CSC supercomputers will be deprecated in the near future.
