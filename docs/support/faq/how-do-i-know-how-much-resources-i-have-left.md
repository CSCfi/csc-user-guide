#How do I know how much computing resources I have left?

By logging in to our customer portal, my.csc.fi. 
You can see your projects, their project numbers, managers and billing 
unit status on the [My Project subpage](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects).

`csc-projects` will give information on 
[active projects on Puhti](../../../computing/overview/#projects-and-quotas)
directly on the command line.

More information with the help flag:

```bash
csc-projects -h
```
