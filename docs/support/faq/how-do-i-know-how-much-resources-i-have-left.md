# How do I know how much computing resources I have left?

By logging in to our customer portal [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi). 
You can see your projects, their project numbers, managers and billing 
unit status on the [*Projects* page](https://my.csc.fi/projects).

On CSC supercomputers, `csc-projects` command will provide information on your
[active projects](../../computing/index.md#projects-and-quotas) directly on the
command-line. For more information about usage, run:

```bash
csc-projects --help
```
