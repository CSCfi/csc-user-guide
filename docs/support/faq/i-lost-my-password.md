# I have lost my password. What should I do?

You can generate a new password for your CSC user account via CSC Customer Portal (https://sui.csc.fi). Type your username to 'CSC username' field and press 'Forgot Password' link on the bottom. Follow the instructions there and you will receive a link to your email address which will allow you to set a new password for your username.
