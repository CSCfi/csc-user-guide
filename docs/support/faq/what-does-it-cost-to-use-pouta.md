# What does it cost to use Pouta?

Pouta usage is free for Finnish academic use if a project application is
accepted. This uses the same process as the HPC systems at CSC. For a detailed
explanation, see
[Pouta Usage policy](../../cloud/pouta/vm-flavors-and-billing.md).

[Academic and commercial pricing](https://research.csc.fi/purchasing) is also
available for cases where we are unable to provide free access or sufficient
resources.

Accounting and billing is based on the same billing units that are used in the
HPC systems at CSC. Academic users can apply for more free billing units
through the [CSC customer portal My CSC](https://my.csc.fi). Paying customers
should contact [CSC Service Desk](../contact.md).
