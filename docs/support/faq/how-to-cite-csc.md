# How to cite CSC in a paper

A good place is the acknowledgements at the end of the manuscript. A typical 
statement is:

> The authors wish to acknowledge CSC â€“ IT Center for Science, Finland, for
> computational resources.

This wording covers both computing time and licenses, and if you've used
**a lot** of resources, you can add: *for generous computational resources.*
