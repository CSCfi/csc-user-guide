# Can I have a personal project, bucket or object in Allas?

All the contents of a project's bucket are available to all project members and
all the project members have full access rights to all the project's buckets
and the objects inside them. Hence, you can **not** have a personal bucket
within a project including other members.

Therefore, the only way to get a personal project or bucket is you being the
only member in the project.
