# How to access the CSC archive service from cPouta?

If you have an account with access to the IDA storage service, you can install an iRODS client 
and save your data there. This is only intended for long term storage of scientific datasets. 
At this time much of the information about IDA is only in the Finnish language but it is 
possible to read using Google Translate. See:
