# How can I find information about my projects?

By logging in to our customer portal [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi). You can see
your projects, their project numbers, managers and billing unit status on the
[*Projects* sub-page](https://my.csc.fi/projects).

Please see also:

* [How to create a new project](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md).
* `csc-projects` â€“ a command-line tool for querying information about your
  [active projects on CSC supercomputers](../../computing/index.md#projects-and-quotas).
