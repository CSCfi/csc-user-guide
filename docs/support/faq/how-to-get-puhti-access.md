#How to get access to Puhti

To get access to Puhti, you need a CSC account and a project with Puhti
service. Please see the [Accounts section](/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/)

## Common problems and some tips

  - Note, that you need to accept the terms for Puhti of use in MyCSC before you can access Puhti. There is some delay before the information is updated to Puhti.
  - Note, that if you have just changed your CSC password, there is longer delay before this information is updated to Puhti.
  - In MyCSC you can check which projects you have, and in the Services list for that project you can see whether the services are accepted (green tick mark indicates this)
  - In Puhti, `csc-workspaces` command will show you which projects you're a member of
