# How to get access to Puhti

To get access to Puhti, you need a CSC account and a project with Puhti service
enabled. Please see
[How to add service access to a project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).

## Common problems and some tips

- Note that you need to accept the terms of use for Puhti in
  [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) before you can access Puhti. Also note that there
  is some delay before the information is synced to Puhti.
- To access Puhti using an SSH client, you must set up SSH keys and add your
  public key to MyCSC.
  See [instructions](../../computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md) and a
  [tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-keys.html).
- You can check which projects you have in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi), and in
  the *Services* list of that project you can see which services are enabled.
- In Puhti, `csc-projects` command will show you information about your
  projects on the command-line.
