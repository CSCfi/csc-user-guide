# SD Desktop Limited Edition

## What is SD Desktop Limited Edition for?

SD Desktop Limited Edition is for analyzing secondary use health and social data, more specifically Findata controlled registry data. SD Desktop Limited Edition has been audited against the Findata regulation.

## What is the difference between standard SD Desktop and SD Desktop Limited Edition?

In SD Desktop Limited edition, there are some restrictions to the service compared to the standard SD Desktop because of the data authority’s requirements for a secondary use environment. Most important limitations include: the CSC project will be managed by CSC instead of the user and other services are not available. Read more in SD Desktop service description.

## How can I access my dataset with SD Desktop Limited Edition?

First, you need to have a data permit from Findata. Then you need to request for a CSC project from our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) with the data permit and create a CSC account if you do not have one already. The data will be transported directly to the service from Findata and available only for verified project members on the virtual Desktop. You can log in to SD Desktop Limited Edition on [the same page](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi/) as to the standard SD Desktop.

## Can I combine my own data with registry data in SD Desktop Limited Edition?

All the data processed in SD Desktop Limited Edition must come from Findata. If you want to combine your own data with registry data, you need to ask Findata to do that for you.

## Is it possible to install software to SD Desktop Limited Edition?

The programs available on the Desktop are [listed in the user guide](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop/#default-programs-available-on-sd-desktop). Only Findata can provide the necessary files to CSC where you can access them on your Desktop. If the software you need is not pre-installed on the Desktop, you need to 1) contact our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) to check if the program is compatible with the Desktop, and 2) request Findata to import the files to your Desktop.

## How can I export my results from the Desktop?

You need to make a request to our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi) to export your results. The results will be exported directly to Findata and you will receive them after the authority’s scrutiny.

## What will happen to my data after the data permit expires?

You will not be able to access your virtual Desktop after the validity period of your data permit ends. If you do not send an amendment application to Findata and request us to extend the duration of your project, you will be removed from the CSC project and the project will be considered inactive. The project and all the data will be deleted after 90 days, according to CSC’s data retention policy. You need to have all your results exported from the Desktop before the data permit expires – you cannot access them when the permit is no longer valid.
