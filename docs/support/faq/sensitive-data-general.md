# General characteristics of the services

## Are CSC Sensitive Data services suitable for any type of reserch and user? 
Yes. The services have been designed to support research professionals with different backgrounds (project manager, postdoc, Ph.D. student, master student, bioinformatician or data analyst,  single research group, or international collaborative project) and from any research field. 
Each service is accessible via user interface and commmand line interface.
If you think specific training material is needed, please contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi (email subject: Sensitive Data). We are happy to know more about your needs and point of view and provide our best support. 

## What type of data can I process using the services?
The data can be stored in SD Connect, analyzed in SD Desktop and published via SD Submit in any format: simple text or spreadsheet files, complex genetic datasets, video files, and images.

## Do you provide a backup service?
There is no backup service available for SD Connect (storage and share) and SD Desktop (compute). However, SD Connect uses an object storage system that is fails to tolerate disk breaks. SD Submit (publish) will always maintain a second copy of the stored data.


## Can I  store or process ‘real data ‘ using  the current Open Beta versions of SD Connect and SD Desktop?
Yes, you can already store sensitive encrypted data in SD Connect and process them in SD Desktop. Security is not affected by the Open Beta versions status of the services.
However, SD Connect and SD Desktop have not yet been security audited. Because of that users may not process any personal data granted for the purposes of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (552/2019) by Findata.

## What do the Open Beta versions status of Sensitive Data Services imply in practice?
During the Open Beta phase, we constantly improve the user interface, add features and resolve bugs. This might lead to service interruptions. The Open Beta versions of the services also have some limitations (e.g. some of the processes are still manual).
