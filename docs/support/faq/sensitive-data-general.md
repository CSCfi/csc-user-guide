# General characteristics of the services

## Are CSC Sensitive Data services suitable for any research professional? 
Yes. The services have been designed to support research professionals with different backgrounds (project manager, postdoc, Ph.D. student, master student, bioinformatician or data analyst,  single research group, or international collaborative project) and from any research field. 
Each service is accessible via a user interface and command-line interface.
If you think specific training material is needed, don't hesitate to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi (email subject: Sensitive Data). We are happy to know more about your needs and point of view and provide our best support. 

## Are CSC Sensitive Data services suitable for any research project? 


## What type of data can I process using the services?
The data can be stored in SD Connect, analyzed in SD Desktop, and published via SD Submit in any format: simple text or spreadsheet files, complex genetic datasets, video files, and images.

## Do you provide a backup service?
There is no backup service available for SD Connect (storage and share) and SD Desktop (compute). However, SD Connect uses an object storage system that is fails to tolerate disk breaks. SD Submit (publish) will always maintain a second copy of the stored data.


## Can I  store or process 'real data' using the current Open Beta versions of SD Connect and SD Desktop?
You can already store sensitive encrypted data in SD Connect and process them in SD Desktop. Security is not affected by the Open Beta versions status of the services.
However, SD Connect and SD Desktop have not yet been security audited. Because of that, users may not process any personal data granted for the purposes of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (552/2019) by Findata.

## What does the Open Beta versions status of Sensitive Data Services imply in practice?
We constantly improve the user interface, add features, and resolve bugs during the Open Beta phase. This might lead to service interruptions. The Open Beta versions of the services also have limitations (e.g., some of the processes are still manual). Check the services [webpage](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data-services-future-development) for more information and constant updates. 


## Are CSC Sensitive Data service free of charge?
The Sensitive Data Services are free of charge for Finnish academics, according to CSC General Terms of use (https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use). However, each service consumes resources  (billing units for their use and quota for allocation of storage space). 

* Regarding billing units:

When you create a new CSC project, you have about 10.000 billing units. 

You can find out how many billing units SD Desktop and Allas (forSD Connect) will use based on your needs with this calculator: https://research.csc.fi/pricing at the bottom of the page.  Here you can estimate the cost in billing units or in euros (for 100 TB/two years, you need about  1 594 320 billing units, or 50 TB  394 200 billing units /year).

Once you have estimated how many billing units your project would need on a yearly basis, you can apply for more resources following [these instructions](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md).  If you need a longer allocation, an extension needs to be applied several weeks before the allocation ends. However, CSC does support longer project times. For this a separate discussion and an agreement is needed. 

* Regarding quotas:

When you apply for a new CSC project and service access for Allas, you have  a default quota of about 10 TB of storage. If you need more storage space, you can write to servicedesk@csc.fi and apply for more. 

The costs for storage space in Allas/SD Connect (both quota and billing units) up to around 100â€“200 TB should be covered by the Ministry of Education for academic research use. 

If you are planning to store more than 200 TB of data for more than 1-2 years, a separate discussion and an agreement is needed.

One important note is that, once you end your research and submit your manuscript you can then use specific services to store part of your data in our repositories (Federated EGA for genetic data and we are working on a  specific repository for images).  In this case the data is stored (under controlled access) for longer periods, CSC maintains two copies of it and you do not need to have a CSC project or consume billing units.

## How can I share sensitive data with collaborators

You can share sensitive data with your collaborators in two different ways. 1) You can transfer encrypted sensitive data using SD Connect. This operation requires a few planning steps and you can learn more in our quick guide or user guide. 2) Another way to share sensitive data with collaborators is to give them access to your SD Desktop. They will then be able to analyze the sensitive data you previously downloaded to SD Desktop, but they will not be able to export it outside the Desktop or make copies of it.
