# I'm moving abroad. Can I still use CSC services? 

If you are leaving abroad, e.g., as a visiting or post-doc researcher, you
have the right to use CSC's services as long as some connection to a Finnish
higher education institution or state research institute remains. This could
be, for example, a collaboration with your old research group, in which case
you could be invited to a CSC project by the PI as an international
collaborator. For more details, see
[Free-of-charge use cases](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases).

In case you have problems using CSC's services abroad, please
[contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) to locate the problem.
