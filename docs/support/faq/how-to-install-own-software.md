# Cannot find the application you are looking for?

We provide a
[comprehensive selection of pre-installed scientific software and HPC libraries](../../apps/index.md)
on CSC supercomputers. Still, sometimes an application you'd need might be
missing. Here's how to proceed:

1. It *is* possible to install software on CSC supercomputers by yourself.
   Please consider this as the first option. See the
   [general instructions](../../computing/installing.md), and
   [multiple tutorials for different code types](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/part-2/installing/).
   If you get stuck, [CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) is happy to support you
   in installing software yourself.
2. You may also [contact CSC Service Desk](../contact.md) with your software
   installation request. Given enough requests, we may consider pre-installing
   a particular application, or purchasing a license for it if the software in
   question is proprietary. However, please note that **we cannot promise to
   pre-install all requested applications** as we have thousands of users and a
   limited software budget.
