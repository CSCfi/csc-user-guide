# How to install my own software in CSC supercomputer

It is possible to install your own software but the instructions from the
web rarely work _as is_. For example, you can't install in the typical
default locations. Instead, the recommended location is your 
`/projappl/project_xxxx` folder.

For details, please consult the
[Installing own software chapter](https://a3s.fi/CSC_training/09_installing.html#/installing-own-software)
of our CSC Computing Environment course materials and follow the related
[hands-on tutorials](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/part-2/installing/).
