# Is there a glossary of the acronyms you keep using?

Yes, there is! In addition to a [specific glossary page](../glossary.md), the
acronyms found across Docs CSC have their definitions embedded as tooltips. For
example, if you move your mouse cursor over (or tap it on mobile/touchscreen)
this underlined acronym: HPC, you'll see its definition as a so-called tooltip.
