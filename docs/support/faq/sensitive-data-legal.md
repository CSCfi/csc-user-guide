## What is the GDPR?
The General Data Protection Regulation is a European Union (EU) data privacy and security law that regulates the management and processing of personal data. 

It defines:    

- what is personal data

- what is data processing

- what are the roles of all the parties involved (Data Controller, Data Processor, Data Subject)

- key principles that regulate EU data protection

Any organization that stores or processes personal information regarding EU citizens is obliged to comply with the GDPR. 

## What are the roles of CSC and its service users under GDPR?  
In GDPR terms, CSC is always a data processor acting on behalf of a data controller. GDPR also requires that this relationship be done in writing. Therefore, the data controller (a group leader, researcher, research organization or their legal representative) needs to sign the Data Processing Agreement with the CSC, a legal contract. CSC never acts as a data controller, but our services give CSC users all the instruments necessary to manage the access to sensitive data. The CSC service user remains fully responsible for the data and is required to choose a service that complies with the security level needed for the data. 

## I am not sure if the data I am working with is sensitive or not. Where can I find support?
You can write to  servicedesk@csc.fi (email subject: Sensitive Data) describing your research and the data you are working with (e.g. providing your Data Management Plan, DMP). You can also contact the legal services or Data Protection Officer in your own organization. They can give you more details about your organization's policies.
