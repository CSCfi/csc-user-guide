# How can I share sensitive data with my collaborators?

You can share sensitive data with your collaborators via:

1) **Data transfer using SD Connect**:
This operation requires a few planning steps. First, your collaborator needs a CSC account and a CSC project (recipient project). Next, you can share files with them from your SD Connect folder for:
- data transfer: the recipient project’s members can copy your folder in SD Connect and download files in decrypted format. Files are also accessible via SD Desktop. Use this when you want to transfer your data to another project.
- data collection: in addition to Transfer data permission, the recipient project’s members can upload new files or delete existing files from your folder in SD Connect. Use this when you want the folder to be your shared workspace.
- analysis via SD Desktop: the recipient project's members can only access the folder content in SD Desktop. Use this when you need maximum certainty that your files are not distributed further.

3) **Data streaming via SD Desktop**:
Another way to share sensitive data with collaborators is to give them access to your private computing environment in SD Desktop.
They will then be able to access and analyse data in your virtual Desktop, but they will not be able to export it outside the computing environment, download it, or make copies of it.

Note: When transferring personal or sensitive data outside the EEA, ensure you have the appropriate legal basis and comply with relevant data protection legislation. Be mindful of this when sharing sensitive data with collaborators via SD Connect or SD Desktop.
