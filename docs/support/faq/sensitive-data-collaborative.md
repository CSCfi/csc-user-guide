# How can I share sensitive data with my collaborators?

You can share sensitive data with your collaborators via:

1) **Data transfer using SD Connect**:
This operation requires a few planning steps. First, your collaborator needs a CSC account and a CSC project. Next, they need to share with you their public encryption key.   For more information, see SD Connect user guide.

2) **Data streaming via SD Desktop**:
Another way to share sensitive data with collaborators is to give them access to your private computing environment in SD Desktop.
They will then be able to access and analyse data in your virtual Desktop, but they will not be able to export it outside the computing environment, download it, or make copies of it.
