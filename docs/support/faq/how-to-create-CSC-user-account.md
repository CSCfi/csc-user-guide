# How to create a CSC user account

If your home organization is a member of the Haka or Virtu federation, you can
[create a CSC account yourself](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).

If you don't have Haka or Virtu, please see
[how to contact us to register](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu).

Please see the
[Accounts section](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) and

for more information.
