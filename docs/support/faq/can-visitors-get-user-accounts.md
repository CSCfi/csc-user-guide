#Can (foreign) visitors in research groups get academic CSC user accounts?

Visitors can apply for the CSC user accounts normally for their academic work. Please see our [free-of-charge use cases and usage policy](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases).  

If they have Haka or Virtu account, they can [create a CSC account themself](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).
If they don't have Haka or Virtu, please [see how to contact us](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu).

 Please see the [Accounts section](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) and [general information about getting started with CSC services](https://research.csc.fi/accounts-and-projects) for more information.
