# Can (foreign) visitors in research groups get academic CSC user accounts?

Visitors can apply for a CSC user account normally for their academic work.
Please see our
[Free-of-charge use cases policy](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases).  

* If they have a Haka or Virtu account, they can
  [create a CSC account by themselves](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).
* If they don't have a Haka or Virtu account, please see
  [Getting an account without Haka or Virtu](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu).

Please see the
[Accounts section](../../accounts/index.md) and
[general information about getting started with CSC's services](https://research.csc.fi/accounts-and-projects)
for more information.
