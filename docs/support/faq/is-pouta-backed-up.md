# Is Pouta backed up?

User data is not backed up. It's the user's responsibility to make backups of
data as needed. Depending on the type and amount of data, users can consider
making another copy at, or using in parallel, one of the other CSC data
services. Please have a look at the [Data section](../../data/index.md).
