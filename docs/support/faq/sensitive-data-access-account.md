# How can start using CSC Sensitive Data Services?

To access SD Connect (store and share) and SD Desktop (compute), you need to set up a CSC account and a CSC project (see: [user guide](./docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/) or [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD5XtevzF3yGtuatGnWmvh39j12lefyp9)). You can then access the services at any time.  
SD Submit and Federated EGA, the services for submitting sensitive data to a national repository for re-use, are in the pilot phase. Contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive Data) for more information.
