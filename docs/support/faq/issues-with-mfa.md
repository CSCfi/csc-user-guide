# How to solve issues with multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## The provided code is wrong or has been expired. Please try again.

To solve the problem:

1. Ensure that the date and time settings of your device are set to "Automatic"
   or synced with the network. Check the time from your phone settings:
    a. Android: **Settings** -> **System** > **Date and time** ->
    **Set time automatically** has to be **on**
    b. iPhone: **Settings** -> **General** -> **Date & time** ->
    **Set time automatically** has to be **on**
2. If the previous step does not work, please delete the CSC MFA secret from
   your phone and start from the very beginning, including scanning the QR
   code (i.e. reset MFA completely). [See instructions](../../accounts/mfa.md).
