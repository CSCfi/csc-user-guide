### Navigation

* The currently focused item can sometimes be hidden beneath the fixed menu bar at the top of the page. (WCAG 2.4.7)
* There are navigation regions on the page without unique labels, which can make them less useful for users of assistive technology. (WCAG 1.3.1)

* Moving keyboard focus out of the search field causes search results to disappear. (WCAG 1.4.13)
