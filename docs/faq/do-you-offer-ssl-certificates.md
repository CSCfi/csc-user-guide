#  Do you offer SSL certificates?

Not as such, but you do have several options:

* if your organization is a Funet member organization and it has
  signed the contract to use the certificate service, you can get free
  certificates via your organization's administrators.
* there are also services that provide free certificates. For example
  Let's Encrypt, available in
  [https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/), provides
  certificates which behave well with most modern web browsers.
* if you are using Rahti, you can use the wildcard certificate for
  `*.rahtiapp.fi` DNS names (see [Do you offer in Rahti SSL
  certificates](../rahti-ssl-certificates)).
