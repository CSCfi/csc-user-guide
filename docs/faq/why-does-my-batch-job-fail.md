# Why does my batch job fail?

Below are common error messages you may get when the job fails, and advice how
to fix them.

## Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The complete error message is as shown below:

```
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
```

This error message refers to Slurm options `--account=<project>` and
`--partition`. The most common causes are:

* Project does not exist.
* Project exists, but you are not a member of it. See how to
  [add a member to project](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md)
* You are a project member, but the project has not been enabled on Puhti. See
  how to
  [add service access for project](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md).
* Partition does not exist.
* Partition exists, but your project is not enabled in it.

## Job violates accounting/QOS policy

The complete error message is as shown below:

```
sbatch: error: AssocMaxSubmitJobLimit
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)
```

The most common causes are:

* Job script is missing the `--account` parameter.
* Your project has too many jobs in the system, either running or queuing.
  Note that internally, Slurm counts each job within an array job as a separate
  job.
* The job was executed directly `./script_name.sh` or `bash script_name.sh`,
  while it should be submitted with `sbatch script_name.sh`.


## Requested node configuration is not available

The complete error message is as shown below:

```
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available
```

The most common causes are:


* Requesting e.g. a GPU or NVME in a partition that does not have them. See [Puhti partitions](../../computing/running/batch-job-partitions.md) for available resources.
