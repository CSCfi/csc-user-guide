# Is it possible to make data in Allas read-only?

## Inside a project  
Inside a project there is currently no _read-only_ mode in Allas. Each project member has full access to the data, which causes a risk: one can accidentally overwrite or delete data.


## Between projects 
You can give another project read-only access to your bucket with [Swift](../../data/Allas/using_allas/swift_client.md#giving-another-project-read-and-write-access-to-a-bucket){target="_blank"} or
[s3cmd](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#giving-another-project-read-access-to-a-bucket){target="_blank"}.


## Sharing URL
In addition, it is possible to make a bucket public, which makes the content available for viewing ('_read-only_') via URLs. The URL to an object in a public bucket is in form of <i>https://bucket_name.a3s.fi/object_name</i> or <i>https://a3s.fi/swift/v1/AUTH_PROJECT_ID/bucket_name/object_name</i> where <i>PROJECT_ID</i> is your computing project's identifier in [UUID](../../data/Allas/using_allas/s3_client.md#giving-another-project-read-access-to-a-bucket){target="_blank"} format.
