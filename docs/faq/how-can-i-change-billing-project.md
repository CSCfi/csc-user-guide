# How can I change which project is billed for my usage?

This depends on which of your services you are using. In each service, you
start by selecting the project first.

* In supercomputer jobs, you select the billing project in the batch script. There is a separate documentation for [Puhti](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-puhti.md) and [Mahti](../../computing/running/creating-job-scripts-mahti.md)
* In Allas, you
  [use the allas-conf command to determine which project is used](../../data/Allas/accessing_allas.md).
* In cPouta or ePouta, you [select the project from the Horizon's dropdown list](../../cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui.md#preparatory-steps).
* In Rahti,
  [OpenStack projects are mapped to CSC projects using the Description](../../cloud/rahti/usage/projects_and_quota.md)
  of the OpenStack project.
