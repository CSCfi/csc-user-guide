# How to cite CSC in a paper

A good place is the acknowledgements at the end of the manuscript. This is a typical one:

The authors wish to acknowledge CSC â€“ IT Center for Science, Finland, for computational resources.

This wording covers both computing time and licenses, and if you've used A LOT of resources, you can add: _for generous computational resources._
