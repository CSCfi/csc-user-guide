# What does it cost to use Pouta?

Pouta usage is free for Finnish academic use if a project application is accepted. This uses the same process as the HPC systems at CSC. For a detailed explanation see: [Pouta Usage policy](/cloud/pouta/vm-flavors-and-billing).

[Academic and commercial pricing](https://research.csc.fi/pricing-of-computing-services) is also available for cases where we are unable to provide free access or sufficient resources.

Accounting and billing is based on the same billing units that are used in the HPC systems at CSC. Academic users can apply for more free billing units through the [CSC Customer Portal](https://my.csc.fi). Paying customers should contact [servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi).
