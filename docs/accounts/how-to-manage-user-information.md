# How to link your CSC user account to external authentication sources

You can link your CSC user account to external authentication mechanisms which can be used side by side on several CSC services.
In our example we will link CSC user account to MyAccessID which we will create on the fly.

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Select 'MyAccessID' on the 'Login Methods' panel
1. When asked for confirmation to do the linking, click 'Confirm'
1. You're now transfered to MyAccessID login page and you must provide your home orgazation to the search field
1. When you've selected your home orgazation you're transfered to your login page and need authenticate
1. If you already have a MyAccessID the linking with your CSC user account is now done automacally
1. If you do not have a MyAccessID you're requested to register your MyAccessID identity.

!!! Note
    If you're invited to a EHPC LUMI project or you're a a EHPC PI you must link your CSC user account with MyAccessID.
    Otherwise you will end up with 2 separate CSC user accounts.
