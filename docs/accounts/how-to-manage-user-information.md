# How to link your CSC user account to external authentication sources

You can link your CSC user account to external authentication mechanisms which can be used side by side on several CSC services.
In our example we will link CSC user account to MyAccessID which we will create on the fly.

!!! Note
    If you're invited to a EHPC LUMI project or you're a a EHPC PI you must link your CSC user account with MyAccessID.
    Otherwise you will end up with 2 separate CSC user accounts.
