project manager will also receive email notifications about the submission.

!!! Note

    Academic projects are requested to fill in the science area,
    publications, etc. If those are irrelevant for your work, your
    project type should probably be Commercial.

    All members of a project can submit billing unit applications.

Billing unit applications cannot be edited after submission, but you
can ask us to reject them, after which you can submit another
application. Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.
