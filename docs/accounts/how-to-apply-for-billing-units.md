# Applying for billing units

Submit a resource application:

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose a project.
1. Under _Resource Applications_, click _Apply for Resources_.
1. Fill in the application and click _Apply_.
1. A link to the submitted application shows up under _Resource applications_, where you can view its details and status. You and your
project manager will also receive email notifications about the submission.
1. When the application has been processed, you will receive another
email to inform how many billing units have been granted.

!!! Note

    Academic projects are requested to fill in the science area,
    publications, etc. If those are irrelevant for your work, your
    project type should probably be Commercial.

    All members of a project can submit billing unit applications.

Billing unit applications cannot be edited after submission, but you
can ask us to reject them, after which you can submit another
application. Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.
