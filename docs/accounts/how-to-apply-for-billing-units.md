# Applying for billing units

**Billing Units** (BUs) are used to allocate resources to users' projects. You
can apply for Billing Units in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) portal and CSC grants
BUs to projects. [Usage consumes billing units](billing.md) but
**no actual payment** is required. However, the amount of billing units must
always remain positive.

Submit a resource application:

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
2. Choose _Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
3. Choose a project.
4. Under _Resource Applications_, click _Apply for Resources_.
5. Fill in the application and click _Apply_.
6. A link to the submitted application shows up under _Resource applications_,
   where you can view its details and status. You and your project manager will
   also receive email notifications about the submission.
7. When the application has been processed, you will receive another
   email to inform how many billing units have been granted.
