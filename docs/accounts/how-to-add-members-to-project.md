# How to add members to project

Project manager is the only person who can add project members. There are two ways to add users to a project. You can either add them directly
or give them an invitation link. Invited users are added automatically to projects, but
they need to [select services](how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) they want to use within the
selected project.

## Adding members directly

Direct addition is the best method if you have a small number of users to add.
Only existing users can be added this way.

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose the project you want new persons to join.
1. Under _Members_, in the _Current_ tab, fill in the username of the first new
   member you wish to add.
1. Click the _plus_ button.
1. Repeat the last two steps for each new member.

A user can be removed from a project by clicking the _X_ button next to the username.

!!! Note

    Project members receive notifications when they are added to projects,
    but no notifications are sent when they are removed.

## Using invitation link

This method is useful if you have tens of users to add, because you do not have
to type in account names. You do not need to know the users' account names.
They do not even have to be registered yet.
