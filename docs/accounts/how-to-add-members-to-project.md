# How to add members to project

There are two ways to add users to a project. You can either add them directly
or give them an invitation link. Users are added automatically to projects, but
they need to [select services](how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) they
want to use with their account.

## Adding members directly

Direct addition is the best method if you have a small number of users to add.
Only existing users can be added this way.

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose the project you want new persons to join.
1. Under _Members_, in the _Current_ tab, fill in the username of the first new
   member.
1. Click the _plus_ button.
1. Repeat the last two steps for each new member.

A user can be removed from a project by clicking the _X_ button next to the username.

!!! Note

    Project manager is the only person who can add project members.

    Project members receive notifications when they are added to projects,
    but no notifications are sent when they are removed.

## Using invitation link

This method is useful if you have tens of users to add, because you do not have
to type in account names. You do not need to know the users' account names.
They do not even have to be registered yet.

### Project manager

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose the project you want new persons to join.
1. Under _Project information_ there is an item _Invitation link_. Click
   _Generate_.
1. Send the link to the members.

### Member

1. [Register for CSC](how-to-create-new-user-account.md) if you have not
   already done so.
1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Click _Apply project membership_.

### Project manager again

1. Login to MyCSC if you have logged out.
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose the project to which you have invited new members.
1. Under _Members_, in the _Waiting approval_ tab, you can find the list of
   users. Approve them with the _check_ button or reject them with the _X_
   button.

!!! Note

    No email is sent when a user clicks _Apply project membership_, so it is
    advisable to remind the project manager if approving the membership
    takes long.
