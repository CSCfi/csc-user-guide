# Creating a new project

!!! Note
    Access to LUMI requires creating a separate LUMI-specific project. [How to create Finnish LUMI projects](how-to-create-new-project.md#how-to-create-finnish-lumi-projects) is detailed below.

A CSC user account is required for creating new projects.

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
2. Choose _My projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
3. Scroll down to the end of the page and choose _Create a new
project_.
4. Fill in the project name and description.
5. Select the project type.
6. Does your project handle personal data? Select _Yes_ or _No_. Read more about [handling personal data in your project](../accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data.md).
7. Tick the boxes _I am eligible to be a project manager..._ and _I
have read and accepted the General Terms of Use for..._
8. Click _Create project_.

!!! Note
    If your work belongs to any of the [free-of-charge use
    cases](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases), select Academic as the project type. Otherwise,
    select Commercial. Academic projects can be
    opened only by employees of Finnish higher education institutions,
    state research institutes, and CSC.

Projects are usually valid for one year at a time, but they can be extended. To extend a project, please see page [How to manage your project](how-to-manage-your-project.md).

## How to create Finnish LUMI projects

LUMI projects are used to manage access to LUMI and the resources provided by it. LUMI projects are restricted to LUMI environment only (LUMI-C, LUMI-G etc.). Finnish LUMI projects are fixed in time and resources, and the total resources must be defined already in the project application.

A Finnish LUMI project can include one or several CSC user accounts and one CSC user account can be a member in several Finnish LUMI projects. Each LUMI project must have a Principal Investigator (i.e. Project Manager), who creates the project and applies for resources, manages the user accounts that belong to the project and is responsible of the resource usage. The LUMI Project Manager is typically a leader of a research team or other senior researcher. See more for [project manager prerequisites](https://research.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager).

LUMI services are free of charge for academic research for members of Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes.

### Creating a LUMI project and applying for resources

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi/) with your CSC user account or Haka/Virtu account
2. Choose **My projects** in the navigation menu on the left.
3. Scroll down to the end of the page and choose **Create a new project**.
4. Fill in the **project name** and **description.**
5. Select LUMI as the **project type**.
6. Select LUMI **access mode** (Regular, Benchmark, or Development)
7. Fill in the **resources**: CPU core hours, GPU hours, Storage hours, and all the **text fields** carefully below. If the data is incomplete or insufficient, the application will be rejected. For Regular Access applications, a list of prior publications and a proper research plan are required. For Benchmark Access, a plan of how the resources will be used for the benchmarks is required, and for Development Access a description of program codes, methods and development objectives is required.
8. Select the **Field of Science**, and fill in the **Keywords**.
9. Does your project handle personal data? Please note: **LUMI projects are not allowed to handle personal data at present**.
10. Tick the box I have read and accepted the LUMI General Terms of Use.
11. Click **Create project**.
12. [Invite the project members](how-to-add-members-to-project.md) after creating a project.
13. Your LUMI project application will be sent to be CSC Resource allocation administration to be processed. The CSC Resource allocation group has meetings [every three weeks](https://research.csc.fi/applying-for-computing-resources).
14. Please note that LUMI access is provided only with SSH keys, not with passwords. After you have received an acceptance confirmation email for your LUMI project request, please [upload your public SSH key to MyCSC according to the instructions](../computing/connecting.md#setting-up-ssh-keys).
