# How to change password

Password of your CSC user account is valid for one year. You will receive notifications from CSC when your password is about to expire. Expired password will not lock you out of your CSC user account if you use one of the following methods to log-in: haka, virtu, or an ssh-key. These three log-in methods effectively bypass the need for a CSC user account password. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend you to change your password in time.

You can change your password in two ways: Using the current password or with a password reset link ordered to your email. You can follow the instructions below.

## Using current password

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
2. Go to _Profile_ and click _Change password_.
3. Enter your current password and the new password twice. Click _Change_.

## Using password reset link

1. Go to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi). Click _Log in_.
2. Choose _CSC Login_.
3. Click _Forgot password?_
4. Enter your CSC username and click _Request a reset link_. Instructions are sent to the email address associated with your CSC user account.
