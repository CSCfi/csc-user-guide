# How to monitor resource usage

CSC resources are measured in billing units (BU). 

Check your BU consumption:

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose a project.
1. The usage is shown under _Resource Usage_.

In the usage plot, you can:

* View the monthly usage by user by hovering the mouse over the bars
* Select or unselect certain users by clicking their username
* Switch between cumulative and regular view

!!! Note

    Do not confuse quotas with resources. Quotas are service-specific
    limits to keep the usage within limits. See the instructions under
    Computing, Cloud and Data for instructions how the remaining quotas
    can be followed up in each service.
