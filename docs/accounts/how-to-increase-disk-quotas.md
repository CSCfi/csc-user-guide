# Increasing the storage capacity in Puhti

The quotas of the scratch and projappl directories of Puhti server can be increased if needed.

You can use MyCSC to manage these quotas.

1.    Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) and **select the project** you want to modify.
2.    In the Services list, click open the settings for **Puhti** service. This opens a page 
      where the project manager can modify the quotas.


You can check the default limit of scratch and projappl areas from the table below. 
If your request exceeds the maximum values listed below, then you need to submit 
a resource request to servicedesk@csc.fi and describe why exceptionally large data resources 
are needed.
  
| Directory | Default size | Maximum size | Default file number limit | Maximum file number limit |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| projappl  |   50 GiB     |  100 GiB     | 100 000                   | 500 000                   |
| scratch Â  |   1TiB       |  20 TiB      | 1 000 000                 | 5 000 000                 |


Note that the extended scratch quota consumes your CSC billing units regardless of how much 
data you actually have in the scratch directory. See [billing](./billing.md) for details. Furthermore, 
even after the quota is increased, the automatic cleaning process will continue removing idle 
files from the scratch directory.
