# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to activate and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CSC customer accounts. CSC’s MFA system integrates with the authentication solutions provided by universities for Haka accounts.

CSC’s MFA uses a time-based one-time passcode system, which works with standard mobile phones with an authentication app. The authentication app is free for users, and multiple app options are available for different mobile devices. You can choose any compatible authentication app.

* Compatible apps are those that use a time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) system. Most of the widely used authentication apps, such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, support this method.

## When is MFA Required?

If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Haka login, you do not need to activate it separately for CSC services. **It is recommended to use your home organization’s Haka authentication if available.**

Otherwise, you must activate MFA once to access CSC research services.

CSC is gradually rolling out MFA across all of it's services. Currently, the following CSC services utilize Multi-factor authentication:

* **SD Connect**  
* **SD Desktop**  
* Coming soon:
    * **Puhti web interface**  
    * **Mahti web interface**  
    * **MyCSC**
  
## Haka authentication and MFA

* If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication for Haka login, you do not need to activate it separately for CSC.
* If your home organization does not provide multi-factor authentication during Haka login, you must activate it yourself in the MyCSC portal under the Profile tab.

## What you need before setting up CSC MFA

Before enabling MFA, make sure you have:

* A CSC user account and password. If you don’t have an account yet, register through the MyCSC customer portal.
* A mobile device that is compatible with an authentication app (essentially any modern smartphone).

## How to activate MFA

### Step 1: Install authentication app

To use MFA, install **an authentication app** on your mobile phone. **If you already have an authentication app on your phone, you can skip this step.**

Some commonly used apps include:

* **Google Authenticator**  
* **Microsoft Authenticator**  
* **Other compatible authentication apps (that are TOTP protocol based)**

Follow the installation instructions provided by your chosen app.

### Step 2: Log in to MyCSC

Log in to the [**MyCSC**](https://my.csc.fi/) website with your username and password, and click the **Profile** icon in the top right corner of the page. A dropdown menu will open, allowing you to select **Profile** (highlighted in the image).

If you have forgotten your CSC user account password, [**here's how you can change it**](../accounts/how-to-change-password.md).

### Step 3: Start the activation of multi-factor authentication

In the **Profile** section, click **Enable** in the Multi-Factor Authentication banner.

### Step 5: Enter verification code

After scanning the QR code, press **Continue**. MyCSC will ask you to enter the six-digit verification code generated by your authentication app. Once entered, **your MFA setup is complete.**

## Problems with MFA

If you are experiencing problems or want to disable your MFA authentication, please contact the [CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md).

!!! note "Reminder"
    If you know you'll be switching to a new phone, remember to disable
    MFA before making the switch. Also, keep your contact information up to date
    in MyCSC in case your account needs to be recovered.

## Logging in with MFA

### Haka users  

1. Choose **Haka** as your authentication method.  
2. Authenticate through your home organization, typically by entering your **username** and **password**.  
3. Type the six-digit code shown in your authentication app.  
4. You are in!  

### CSC MFA users

1. Choose **CSC Login** as your authentication method.  
2. Type in your **username** and **password**.  
3. Type the six-digit code shown in your authentication app.  
4. You are in!

### Summary

Activation of MFA

1. If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Haka login, you do not need to activate CSC’s own MFA separately.
2. If your organization has not enabled Haka MFA, you must activate CSC MFA. To do this, you need an authentication app on your mobile phone. Common options include Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, but any app supporting the TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) protocol will work. Install the app according to its instructions.
3. Log in to the MyCSC customer portal with your username and password, then navigate to the Profile section.
4. In the Profile section, click Enable MFA. This will generate a personal secret key, which must be added to your authentication app. Before proceeding, you will be asked to authenticate again using your username and password.
5. Scan the QR code displayed on the screen using your authentication app.
6. MyCSC will verify the setup by asking you to enter the six-digit verification code generated by the authentication app. Once entered correctly, MFA activation is complete.
7. Using MFA: When logging into a CSC service with MFA, first enter your username and password. Then, you will be prompted to enter the six-digit code from your authentication app.
