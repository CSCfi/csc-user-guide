# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to activate and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CSC customer accounts. CSC’s MFA system integrates with the authentication solutions provided by universities for Haka accounts.

CSC’s MFA uses a time-based one-time passcode system, which works with standard mobile phones with an authentication app. The authentication app is free for users, and multiple app options are available for different mobile devices. You can choose any compatible authentication app.

*   Compatible apps are those that use a time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) system. Most of the widely used authentication apps, such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, support this method.


## When is MFA Required?
If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Haka login, you do not need to activate it separately for CSC services.

Otherwise, you must activate MFA once to access CSC research services.

CSC is gradually rolling out MFA across all of it's services. Currently, the following CSC services utilize Multi-factor authentication:

*   **SD Connect**
*   **SD Desktop**
  
  Coming soon:
*   **Puhti-web**
*   **Mahti-web**
*   **MyCSC**

## Haka Authentication and MFA

*   If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication for Haka login, you do not need to activate it separately for CSC.
*   If your home organization does not provide multi-factor authentication during Haka login, you must activate it yourself in the MyCSC portal under the Profile tab.

## What You Need Before Setting Up CSC MFA
Before enabling MFA, make sure you have:

*   A CSC user account and password. If you don’t have an account yet, register through the MyCSC customer portal.
*   A mobile device that is compatible with an authentication app (essentially any modern smartphone)
 
## How to Activate MFA
**Step 1:** To use MFA, install **an authentication app** on your mobile phone.  **If you already have an authentication app on your phone, you can skip this step.**
Some commonly used apps include:

*   Google Authenticator
*   Microsoft Authenticator
*   Other compatible authentication apps (that are TOTP protocol based)

Follow the installation instructions provided by your chosen app.

**Step 2:** Log in to the [**MyCSC**] (https://my.csc.fi/) website with your username and password, and click the **Profile** icon in the top right corner of the page (highlighted in image). A dropdown menu will open, allowing you to select **Profile.**

*   If you have forgotten your CSC user account password, you can change it [**here are the instructions to change it**](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-change-password/)

**Step 3:** In the **Profile** section, click **Enable*** in the Multi-Factor Authentication banner.

## Problems with MFA
If you are experiencing problems or want to disable your MFA authentication, please contact the [CSC Service Desk.](https://docs.csc.fi/support/contact/) 




    Reminder: If you know you'll be switching to a new phone, remember to disable 
    MFA before making the switch. Also, keep your contact information up to date 
    in MyCSC in case your account needs to be recovered.


## Logging in with MFA
**Haka-users:**
1. Choose **Haka** as your authentication method. 
1. Authenticate through your home organization, typically by entering your **username** and **password**.
1. Type the six-digit code shown in your authentication app
1. You are in!


**CSC-MFA users:**
1. Choose **CSC Login** as your authentication method
1. Type in your **username** and **password**
1. Type the six-digit code shown in your authentication app
1. You are in!
   
    
**Summary:**


    Activation of MFA 
    1. If your home organization has enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Haka login, 
    you do not need to activate CSC’s own MFA separately.
    2. If your organization has not enabled Haka MFA, you must activate CSC MFA. To do this, 
    you need an authentication app on your mobile phone. Common options include 
    Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, but any app supporting the TOTP 
    (Time-Based One-Time Password) protocol will work. Install the app according to its instructions.
    3. Log in to the MyCSC customer portal with your username and password, 
    then navigate to the Profile section.
    4. In the Profile section, click Enable MFA. This will generate a personal secret key, which must 
    be added to your authentication app. Before 
    proceeding, you will be asked to authenticate again using your username and password.
    5. Scan the QR code displayed on the screen using your authentication app.
    6. MyCSC will verify the setup by asking you to enter the six-digit verification code generated by 
    the authentication app. Once entered 
    correctly, MFA activation is complete.
    7. Using MFA: When logging into a CSC service with MFA, first enter your username and password. 
    Then, you will be prompted to enter the six-digit 
    code from your authentication app.



## Problems with MFA

You can disable your MFA by [contacting CSC Service Desk](../support/contact.md). Currently there is a process that requires you to prove your identity when removing the old MFA configuration, before activating the MFA again. You can have one TOTP client in use at any time. If you lose or replace your device, please contact CSC Service Desk.
