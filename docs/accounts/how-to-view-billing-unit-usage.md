# How to view billing unit usage

Consumption of CSC's resources is mainly measured in billing units. IDA and
Kaivos do not consume billing units; they only have quota limits for each
project.

Check your BU consumption:

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose a project.
1. The usage is shown under _Resource Usage_.

In the usage plot, you can:

* View the monthly usage by user by hovering the mouse over the bars
* Select or unselect certain users by clicking their username
* Switch between cumulative and regular view

!!! Note

    Do not confuse quotas with billing units. Quotas are service-specific
    limits to keep the usage within limits. See the instructions under
    Computing, Cloud and Data for instructions how the remaining quotas
    can be followed up in each service.

You can often see usage information of an 'other' user. See the explanation
in FAQ:
