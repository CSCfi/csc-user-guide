# LUMI Helmi Pilot Phase 


Welcome to the LUMI Helmi partition pilot phase! 


* During the pilot phase, approved projects will **only** get 24 hours of access to the LUMI Partition.

* LUMI Helmi users will only have access to the **q_fiqci** partition. For regular LUMI-C queues a separate project will have to be made. 


If you wish to use Quantum Simulators or a test environment CSC currently offers:


* [Kvasi](../../computing/kvasi) - the Quantum Learning Machine (Currently does not offer Qiskit support, Kvasi can be accessed through LUMI in the future)

* [Mahti](../../computing/mahti) through `module load qiskit` and loading of the IQM Qiskit environment.
