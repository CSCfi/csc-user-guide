# Billing

Puhti has a new billing scheme. Billing in the cloud remains as before.

## Puhti 

### Compute billing

Puhti is a heterogenous system with CPU, GPU and IO nodes and nodes with varying amounts of memory. Moreover, it is possible to use only a fraction of a node and its various resources. The billing scheme charges billing units (BU) in fair way based on the reserved amount of node resources.

In the billing scheme, the BU consumption rate of a compute job depends linearly on the number of requested cores and GPUs and the amount of requested memory (per core). More precisely:

 * Each reserved core consumes **1** BU per hour.
 * Each GiB of reserved memory consumes **0,1** BUs per hour.
 * Each reserved GiB of NVMe disk (if available) consumes **0,006** BUs per hour.
 * Each reserved GPU consumes **60** BUs per hour.

The total BU consumption per hour is the sum of the above terms:

` Total BUs = ( NCores * 1 + MemGiBs * 0,1 + NVMeGiBs * 0,006 + NGPUs * 60 ) * Walltime hours `

## Mahti

### Compute billing

In contrast to Puhti, on Mahti resources are used and billed in full nodes only.

 * Each reserved node consumes **100** BUs per hour. 

## Lustre scratch disk billing

The default 1 TiB scratch disk quota is free. Increased quota charges:

* 1 TiB consumes **50 000** BUs per year.

## Allas 

The Allas object storage charges:

* 1 TiB consumes **1** BUs per hour.

## Estimating billing units

To make it easier for customers to estimate how many billing units
they need, there is a [billing unit
calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-and-monitoring) available for all CSC compute and storage services.
