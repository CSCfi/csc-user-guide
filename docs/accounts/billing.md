# Billing

CSC's services are free of charge for academic research, teaching or training for members of Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes.

See the [Billing unit and price calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units#buc){:target="_blank"}
at research.csc.fi.

The billing rates for the services are as follows:
 * [Puhti and Mahti billing](../computing/hpc-billing.md)
 * Allas object storage billing:  1 TiB consumes **1** BU per hour. Only actual data stored in Allas is billed.
 * [Pouta billing](../cloud/pouta/accounting.md).
 * [Rahti billing](../cloud/rahti/billing.md).
 * [Kvasi billing](../computing/quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi-billing.md)


## Monitoring billing unit consumption

In the _My Projects_ page in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) you can study the
billing unit consumption and apply for more billing units. There you can easily
check who consumed the billing units, when they were consumed and in which
service. Note that storage-related billing unit consumption (in Scratch and
Allas) is not linked to a specific user account and is reported as "other".
