# Billing

CSC's services are free of charge for academic research, teaching or training
for members of Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes.

See the [Billing unit and price calculator](https://research.csc.fi/billing-units#buc){:target="_blank"}
at research.csc.fi.

**The billing rates for the services are as follows:**

* [Puhti and Mahti billing](../computing/hpc-billing.md)
* Allas object storage billing:  1 TiB consumes **1** BU per hour. Only actual
   data stored in Allas is billed.
* [Pouta billing](../cloud/pouta/accounting.md)
* [Rahti billing](../cloud/rahti/billing.md)
* [Kvasi billing](../computing/quantum-computing/kvasi/kvasi-billing.md)
* [SD Connect and SD Desktop billing](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-access.md#default-storage-space-and-billing-units-consumption)



!!! info "Note"

    For LUMI billing, [see the LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/billing/){ target=_blank }.

## Monitoring billing unit consumption

In the _My Projects_ page in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) you can study the
billing unit consumption and apply for more billing units. There you can easily
check who consumed the billing units, when they were consumed and in which
service. Note that storage-related billing unit consumption (in Scratch and
Allas) is not linked to a specific user account and is reported as "other".



## Restricted service access when billing units have been consumed

When all billing units in your CSC project have been consumed, service usage can be limited (for example, for a 30-day grace period), or service access can be restricted. 
No data is deleted when the total amount of billing units is zero or negative. You will receive a notification via email, and you can regain access to the service by applying for additional billing units using the MYCSC portal. 

Limitations for the services consuming billing units are the following: 
* [Puhti and Mahti](../computing/usage-policy.md#running-out-of-billing-units)
* [Sensitive Data (SD) Desktop](../../data/sensitive-data/sd-access.md#restricted-service-access-when-billing-units-have-been-consumed)
