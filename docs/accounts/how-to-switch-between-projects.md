# How to switch between projects

On the Dashboard of MyCSC, there is a chart showing how much resources
you have left in one of your projects. You can change that project as
follows:

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Select the default billing project.
1. Click _Save_.

The selected default billing project is migrated to several services:

* In Puhti, the billing project dictates the default group ownership
  of new files you create (there is one Linux group for each
  project).
* In Taito, the usage is by default charged to the billing
  project. The billing project also dictates the default group
  ownership of new files you create (there is one Linux group
  for each project).
* In Rahti, the usage is by default charged to the billing project.

See service-specific instructions under _Computing, Cloud and Data_ for more details about project selection in each service.
