# How to manage your projects

CSC Project needs to be extended yearly.

* Project members receive reminders about the project expiration.
* The Project Manager can extend the project in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi)
* When granted new Billing Units (BU) project is extended automatically by a year.
* Projects that use [Fairdata IDA](https://ida.fairdata.fi/) will be extended automatically.

!!! Note
    Project Manager’s CSC account inactivation closes the project for all project members.

* The Project Manager’s CSC user account needs to be kept active. CSC will send notifications with instructions by email before any user accounts or passwords expire. Please note, an active user account does not extend the project.
* Keep user information such as email address up to date.
* If needed, Project Manager is responsible for transferring Project Manager duties to another member of the Project.

Users are primarily responsible for [moving data](../data/moving/index.md) or deleting the project content themselves before the project is closed. 
If you're unsure about your CSC Project's or Account's status, please log in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) to extend your project or change your account password.
If you want to close your Project, change your account email address or change the Project Manager, kindly [contact ServiceDesk](../support/contact.md)

## Project closure

CSC Projects will automatically close on their end date. Before the CSC Project ends, all project members will receive multiple email notifications about the closure. The Project Manager can extend the CSC Project before it is closed.

The Project Manager can also close the CSC Project earlier through the MyCSC portal. Project members will be notified when the CSC Project is closed. Please note that content in services will be deleted after the CSC Project closure, unless otherwise agreed. If you want to preserve any content (e.g., data, software, servers, systems, or processes), please export and delete them from CSC services before the CSC Project end date.

If the CSC Project closure was unintentional, the Project Manager should contact CSC as soon as possible at servicedesk@csc.fi. Upon request from the Project Manager, the CSC Project can be re-opened or temporary access to services can be provided.

Content cannot be retrieved after 90 days from the CSC Project closure.

#### When the Project is closed
