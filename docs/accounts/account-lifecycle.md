# CSC user account lifecycle

Password of your CSC user account is valid for one year. You will receive notifications from CSC when your password is about to expire. Expired password will not lock you out of your CSC user account if you use one of the following methods to login: Haka, Virtu, or SSH key. These three login methods effectively bypass the need for a CSC user account password. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend you to change your password in time.

If CSC user account password expires and you cannot login via Haka, Virtu or SSH key, please contact CSC Service Desk.

## Haka
This login method is available to Finnish universities, polytechnics and research institutions. In this login method you use user account and password of your home organization instead of the user account provided by CSC. This works because unique user id from your home organization is linked to your CSC user account.

If you use this login method, you will have to login to CSC services via Haka at least once every 6 months to keep your CSC user account active.

## Virtu
This login method is available to government agencies. In this login method you use user account and password of your home organization instead of the user account provided by CSC. This works because unique user id from your home organization is linked to your CSC user account.

## LS Login
LS Login is an authentication service of the European Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS RI), is a community platform established via the EOSC-Life project and operated by Masaryk University, Brno, CZ. This works because unique user id from LS Login is linked to your CSC user account.

## SSH keys
SSH keys are functionally similar to usernames and passwords and provide means to access CSC systems in a secure manner, but without having to manually type usernames and passwords. Only a specific subset of CSC services support SSH keys and is not supported in any web browser-based login methods. This works because your SSH keys are linked to your CSC user account.

## Expiration of user accounts

If you have been granted an account for a fixed period, the account expires when the period ends. Accounts created with Haka or Virtu are validated periodically. The following methods can be independently used to login depending on the service: Haka, Virtu, password or SSH key.

User accounts may be closed if their owner is not reachable, i.e. emails bounce back.
