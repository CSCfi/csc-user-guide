# How to create new user account

There are three different types of CSC user accounts: ordinary accounts for general use (which you can get with or
without Haka or Virtu), student accounts for courses, and machine-to-machine robot accounts for managing services.

## Getting an account with Haka or Virtu

If your home organization is a member of the Haka or Virtu federation, you
can create an account yourself.

1. Go to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Click _Log in_ or _Getting started_.
1. Click _Virtu_ or _Haka_ depending on which federation your home
organization is a member of.
1. Select your home organization and log in to their identity service.
1. Fill in your information on the _Sign up_ page.
1. Set your password using 12 characters or more, containing both upper
and lowercase letters and at least one number. No special characters are
allowed.
1. You will receive your CSC user account information via email.

## Getting an account without Haka or Virtu

The preferred registration method is to log in using Haka or
Virtu. If they are not available, an alternative method is to mail
the following information to servicedesk@csc.fi.

This mostly applies to foreign collaborators of Finland-based research
groups, but basically anybody who has a project to join can register
this way.

The application should include:

* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713)
* Collaborator's name, organization and email address
* Period of time for which the right for use is applied

!!! Note

    If you cannot use Haka or Virtu, and do not have a project to
    join, you can get an account if your home organization has a
    contract with CSC or you have been granted resources in a
    program. Contact servicedesk@csc.fi and provide details
    about your use case, and we will check your eligibility.

## Getting student accounts for courses

If you are a teacher and you wish to have course accounts for your
students, please send the following information to servicedesk@csc.fi. You must be a
registered CSC user before course accounts can be created.

* Start and end date of the course
* Username of the teacher (responsible for the accounts)
* Teacher's mobile number (to which the passwords are sent via SMS)
* The number of accounts needed

You will receive the accounts' information via email and SMS.

!!! Note

    Student accounts are only valid during the
    course. Please request the accounts in advance, at least one week before
    the course begins.

## Getting a machine-to-machine robot account

If you are a registered CSC user and need another account for managing
services that you run in the CSC services, we can create a
machine-to-machine robot account for you. Send the following
information to servicedesk@csc.fi.

* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713) of the project your
  service uses
* The CSC service your service uses (e.g. cPouta, Rahti)
* Your mobile number (to which the password are sent via SMS)

## Expiration of user accounts

If you have been granted an account for a fixed period, the account expires when the period ends. Accounts created with Haka or Virtu do not have an end date, and they remain valid as long as the account's password is changed once a year.

All accounts are immediately terminated if their owner is not reachable, i.e. emails bounce back.

!!! Note

    If you want to terminate your account, simply skip the annual password
    change. The account will be terminated one month after the password
    has expired. If you want to terminate your account more quickly,
    contact servicedesk@csc.fi
