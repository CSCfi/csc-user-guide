# Overview

The customer portal [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) is a gateway to CSCâ€™s
services, including as supercomputers, software, cloud services and data
storage. The old portal [SUI](https://sui.csc.fi) will be shut down by
the end of the year.

## MyCSC

In MyCSC you can:

* Register as a CSC customer
* Manage your personal information
* Create projects
* Add members to projects
* Add services of your choice to your projects
* Apply for billing units (BU) for your projects
* Monitor the BU consumption of you projects

## SUI

Not all features of SUI are yet available in MyCSC. For example, the [IDA research data
storage](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/becoming-an-ida-user/) is
still accessed via SUI until this feature is implemented in MyCSC.
