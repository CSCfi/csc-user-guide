# Accounts

## Overview

The usage of the computing and storage services of CSC is based on _user accounts_ and _projects_:

*   **User accounts** are used to authenticate and manage users. Each user should have just one user account at CSC.  User accounts are always personal. It is forbidden to share the credentials of an account with other persons or allow other persons to use the account.

*   **CSC projects** are used to manage access to CSC services and the resources provided by CSC. Access to CSC services like, Puhti, Allas or cPouta 
is granted to CSC projects. The same applies to the billing units that are consumed when these services are used.
A CSC project can include one or several CSC user accounts and one user account can be a member in several projects. Each CSC project must have a Project Manager, who creates the project, manages the user accounts and services that belong to the project and is responsible of the resource usage.
The Project Manager is typically a leader of a research team or other senior researcher. See more detailed [project manager prerequisites](https://www.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager).

CSC's services are free of charge for academic research, teaching or training for members of Finnish higher education
institutions and state research institutes.
[Usage consumes billing units](billing.md) but no actual payment is required.
However, the amount of billing units must always remain positive.
