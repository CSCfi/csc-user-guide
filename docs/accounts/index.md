# Accounts

## Overview

Each user usually needs a user account and a project to access CSC's services:

1. [Create a user account](how-to-create-new-user-account.md)
1. [Create](how-to-create-new-project.md) or
   [join a project](how-to-add-member-to-project.md)
1. [Add service access for your project](how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md)
1. [Apply for billing units](how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) or
   [disk quota](how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md), if needed
1. [Renew your password](how-to-change-password.md) annually

All these tasks can be performed in the
[self-service portal MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).

CSC's services are free of charge for academic research, teaching or training for members of Finnish higher education
institutions and state research institutes.
[Usage consumes billing units](billing.md) but no actual payment is required.
However, the amount of billing units must always remain positive.

The Puhti supercomputer has a separate partition for the Finnish Meteorological
Institute. FMI users are also allowed to use the general partition of Puhti for normal
projects.
[See the specific instructions for FMI users](fmi.md).
