# TensorBoard
The TensorBoard app launches [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard), [TensorFlow](../../apps/tensorflow.md)'s Visualization Toolkit on a compute node.

To launch it select the log directory where you have data to visualize and the resources for the Slurm job.  
Note that TensorBoard is very memory intensive but has low CPU usage.
