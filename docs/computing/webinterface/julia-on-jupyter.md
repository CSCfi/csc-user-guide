# Julia on Jupyter
We can use the [**Julia Language**](../../apps/julia.md) on Jupyter by selecting the *Julia-Jupyter* application.
Inside the Jupyter session, we can start notebooks with different Julia kernels, such as `julia/1.8.5`.
Starting a kernel automatically loads the corresponding Julia module.
The Julia kernel uses the [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package.
The Jupyter installation for Julia is separate from the Jupyter installation for Python.
