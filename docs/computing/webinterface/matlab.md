# MATLAB

The app will start a MATLAB session on Puhti with the specified resources.
Currently, only the R2023b release with Parallel Computing and Compiler SDK toolboxes is installed.

In addition to computing resources, partition and project, there is an **optional** "License file" field.
With it you can specify path to your own home organisation's license server to obtain MATLAB license
from there instead. This option is useful, for example, in situations where all CSC's MATLAB licences are already reserved.

For documentation on using MATLAB, see the [MATLAB documentation](../../apps/matlab.md).
