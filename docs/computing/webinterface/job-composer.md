# Job Composer
The Job Composer app can be used for creating and managing batch jobs.

Jobs are created from templates, which can be selected in a few ways

 * Copy a template from the system
 * Copy a template you have previously created
 * Use a previous job as template

## Getting started

An example of running a basic Slurm job.
Create a job from the default template by clicking `From Default Template` in the `New Job` dropdown.
To edit the name of the job click `Job Options`.
The batch job script can be edited by clicking `Open Editor`
