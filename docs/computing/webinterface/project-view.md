# Project view

The _Project view_ tool visualizes info of your current Puhti or Mahti
projects. It contains also a _Disk quotas_ tab, which shows you your Lustre
quotas. 

!!! info-label
    Note that you can only view your projects in the Project view. To modify
    your projects or quotas, please use [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi/).

Besides listing your Puhti or Mahti Lustre quotas, the Disk quotas tab can
group quotas together based on project or by disk area. The quotas can also be
sorted by clicking the column headers and there is a search function available
as well.
