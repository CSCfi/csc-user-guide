# Compiling applications in LUMI

## General instructions

* The LUMI software policy is that users should install required software themselves.
* To support this process, the [EasyBuild](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/easybuild/) tool is provided with accompanying build recipes for several applications. For more details, see the [LUMI software documentation pages](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/).
* Compiling applications manually is of course also possible. Please see [the LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/) for more information on developing and compiling applications in the LUMI programming environment.
