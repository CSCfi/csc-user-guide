# Compiling applications in Puhti

## General instructions

- Whenever possible, use the [local disk](disk.md#login-nodes) on the login node for compiling software.
    - Compiling on the local disk is much faster and shifts load from the shared file system. 
    - The local disk is cleaned frequently, so please move your files elsewhere after compiling. 


## Building CPU applications

C/C++ and Fortran applications can be built with Intel or GNU
compiler suites. The compiler suite is selected via the [Modules](modules.md)
system, i.e.
```
module load intel
```
or
```
module load gcc
```
Different applications function better with different suites, so the selection
needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.

The actual compiler commands for building a serial application with the two
suites:

| Compiler suite | C  | C++ | Fortran |
| :------------- | :- | :-- | :------ |
| [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe/documentation/get-started) | icc | icpc | ifort |
| [GNU](https://gcc.gnu.org) | gcc | g++ | gfortran |

Intel and GNU compilers use different compiler options. The recommended basic optimization 
flags are listed in the table below. It is recommended to start from the safe level
and then move up to intermediate or even aggressive, while making sure the results are 
correct and the program's performance has improved.

| Optimisation level | Intel                        | GNU               |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Safe**           | -O2 -xHost -fp-model precise | -O2 -march=native |
| **Intermediate**   | -O2 -xHost                   | -O3 -march=native |
| **Aggressive**     | -O3 -xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -fimf-use-svml=true -qopt-zmm-usage=high| -O3 -march=native -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mprefer-vector-width=512|

Please note that not all applications benefit from the AVX-512 vector set
(`-xHost` or `-march=native`). It may be a good idea to also test AVX2 
(`-xCORE-AVX2` or `-mavx2`) and compare the performance.

A detailed list of options for the Intel and GNU compilers can be found on the _man_
pages (`man icc/ifort`, `man gcc/gfortran` when the corresponding programming
environment is loaded, or in the compiler manuals (see the links above).

## Building GPU applications

Both the CUDA and OpenACC programming models are supported on Puhti. 
Specific modules have to be loaded in order to use them.

For example, to load the CUDA 10.1 environment:
```bash
module load gcc/8.3.0 cuda/10.1.168
```

Or to load the PGI compiler for OpenACC:
```bash
module load pgi
```

For more detailed information about the available modules, please see `module
spider cuda` or `module spider pgi`.

### CUDA

The CUDA compiler (`nvcc`) takes care of compiling the CUDA code for the target
GPU device and passing on the rest to a non-CUDA compiler (`gcc`).

To generate code for a given target device, tell the CUDA
compiler what compute capability the target device supports. On Puhti, the
GPUs (Volta V100) support compute capability 7.0. Specify this using
`-gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70`.

For example, compiling a CUDA kernel (`example.cu`) on Puhti:
```bash
nvcc -gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 example.cu
```

In principle, it is also possible to target multiple GPU architectures by repeating 
`-gencode` multiple times for different compute capabilities. However, this is
not necessary on Puhti, since there is only one type of GPU.

### OpenACC

OpenACC is supported with the PGI compilers (`pgcc`, `pgfortran`).
To enable OpenACC support, one needs to give `-acc` flag to the compiler.

To generate code for a given target device, tell the compiler
what compute capability the target device supports. On Puhti, the GPUs (Volta
V100) support compute capability 7.0. Specify it with `-ta=tesla:cc70`.

For example, to compiling C code that uses OpenACC directives (`example.c`):

```bash
pgcc -acc -ta=tesla:cc70 example.c
```

For information about what the compiler actually does with the OpenACC
directives, use `-Minfo=all`.


## Building MPI applications

There are currently two MPI environments available: **hpcx-mpi** and **intel-mpi**. The default is **hpcx-mpi**, which is 
also recommended to begin with.

If **hpcx-mpi** is incompatible with your application or delivers insufficient performance, 
please try another environment. All MPI
implementations can be used with both Intel and GNU compiler suites. The PGI
compiler cannot presently be used with MPI. The MPI environments can be used
via `module load`, i.e.
```bash
module load hpcx-mpi
```

When building MPI applications, use _mpixxx_ compiler wrappers
that differ depending on the compiler suite and the MPI environment:

| Compiler suite | hpcx-mpi               | intel-mpi                 |
| :------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Intel          | mpifort, mpicc, mpicxx | mpiifort, mpiicc, mpiicpc |
| GNU            | mpif90, mpicc, mpicxx  | mpif90, mpicc, mpicxx     |


## Building OpenMP and hybrid applications

Additional compiler and linker flags are needed when building OpenMP or
MPI/OpenMP hybrid applications:

| Compiler suite | OpenMP flag |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Intel          | -qopenmp    |
| GNU            | -fopenmp    |
