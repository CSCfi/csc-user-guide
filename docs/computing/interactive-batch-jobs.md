# Interactive batch jobs
Interactive batch jobs can be used in Puhti for running graphical interfaces or other tasks that require input from the user during the execution of the computing task. Note, that you may need to queue for SLURM to allocate these resources, except if you choose Puhti-shell, see below.

The most easy way to run interactive batch jobs is to use Puhti-shell, described in chapter ***N*** of this guide. When a Puhti-shell session is opened, the session is actually an interactive batch job, that has following properties:

- Unlimited running time
- Computing capacity up to 4 cores per session
- Shared memory of up to 128 GB per session

You can open *Puhti-shell* session, either by directly connecting puhti-shell.csc.fi:
```batch
ssh -X taito-shell.csc.fi -l csc_user_id
```
or if you have already logged in to Puhti, you can open a Taito-shell session with command:
```batch
sinteractive
```

In cases, you can't use puhti-shell / sinteractive ( e.g. in the case of interactive mpi jobs), you can use the *srun* command to launch interactive batch job sessions. For example command:
```batch
 srun -n1 -t02:00:00 --x11=first --pty $SHELL
```
would launch interactive batch jobs session, running the default command shell <var>($SHELL)</var>. In the command above, one core (<var>-n1</var> ) is reserved for two hours (<var>-t02:00:00</var>). The definition <var>--x11=first</var> sets up the x11 connection so that graphical user interfaces can be used.

Bellow is a sample session where the VMD molecular visualization program is started on an interactive batch job session. Note that after the *srun* command, the commands are not executed in the login node any more. In stead the VMD is now started in one of the computing nodes (node c120 in this case) and thus VMD is not causing extra load to the login node:
```
[kkayttaj@taito-login4 kkayttaj]$ srun -n1 -t02:00:00 --x11=first --pty $SHELL
[kkayttaj@c120 kkayttaj]$ module load vmd
VMD version 1.9.1 is now in use
[kkayttaj@c120 kkayttaj]$ vmd
```

You can also use interactive batch job sessions to test your software. In these cases you can use *srun* as above or alternatively, first the resource allocation with command *salloc* and then submit jobs with *srun* command.

In the example bellow a request for 48 cores (<var>-n</var> 48) with 1 GB/core (<var>--mem-per-cpu=1000</var>) for 30 minutes (<var>-t00:30:00</var>) is submitted with the *salloc* command. Two full Puhti nodes nodes will be reserved for the interactive job as 24 cores will be used on one node (<var>--ntasks-per-node=24</var>). Once the resource allocation is done the Gromacs jobs can be launched using the *srun* command:
```
$ salloc -n 48 --ntasks-per-node=24 --mem-per-cpu=1000 -t00:30:00 -p parallel
$ srun mdrun_mpi -s topol1 -dlb yes
$ srun mdrun_mpi -s topol2 -dlb yes
$ exit
```
In the example above the *exit* command closes the resource allocation done by the *salloc* command.
