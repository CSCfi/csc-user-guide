# Quantum Projects on LUMI 

Access to **Helmi** and **Q50** requires a LUMI project with allocated quantum computing resources. 
To get started, create a LUMI project via MyCSC. Each project must have a **Principal Investigator** as the Project Manager, typically a senior researcher.


Detailed instructions on the process of creating a general LUMI project via MyCSC are here:

* [How to create a LUMI project and apply for resources](../../../accounts/how-to-create-new-project.md#how-to-create-finnish-lumi-projects)

!!! info "Getting Started"
	To get started with Helmi/VTT Q50 see
	[Access Helmi through LUMI](helmi-from-lumi.md).
