# Setting up a LUMI project and accounts for accessing the Quantum computers

This page outlines the steps to set up a LUMI account and project for accessing the **Helmi(VTT Q5)** and **VTT Q50**  quantum computers. It is assumed that you have some knowledge of supercomputing systems. If you're new, start with the [overview of CSC supercomputers](../../computing/index.md).

To access Helmi or Q50, you must first create a LUMI project with quantum computing resources: [Quantum Projects on LUMI](projects.md).

Once the project is created, the **Principal Investigator (PI)** can invite other users: [How to add members to project](../../accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project.md)

The project PI is responsible for ensuring that the [Helmi Terms of Use](https://a3s.fi/FiQCI/Helmi-Terms-of-Use-2022.pdf) or [Q50 Terms of Use](https://a3s.fi/FiQCI/VTT_Quantum_Academic_Use_EULA.pdf) are followed.

## Connect to LUMI

Follow the official instructions to connect to the LUMI system: [Connecting to LUMI â€“ Official Documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/).

Details for running jobs on the quantum computers through LUMI can found in the [Running quantum jobs](running-quantum-jobs.md) page.

## Support channels

For support with access via LUMI, contact the  [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), reachable at servicedesk@csc.fi.
