# Sending e-mail from Rahti 2

The procedure is the same as for [sending an e-mail from cPouta](../pouta/additional-services.md).

you need to configure your mail transfer agent (MTA) to use the following SMTP relay server (a.k.a. smarthost):

```
smtp.pouta.csc.fi:25
```

The server does not require authentication.

When sending e-mail, you need a valid `Sender` address in your e-mails, such as your university e-mail address, since this will be validated by the SMTP server. Please note that this is a different e-mail header attribute from the `From` attribute.

If you want to set up any services on _Rahti 2_ that generate a large amount of SMTP traffic (e.g. public mailing lists), please contact the CSC Service Desk to coordinate this.

## Example

This python script could be used:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import smtplib

sender = 'sender@domain.com'
receivers = ['destination@domain.com']

message = """From: SENDER NAME <%s>
To: DESTINATION NAME <%s>
Subject: SMTP e-mail test

This is a test e-mail message.
""" % (sender, receivers[0])

try:
   smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.pouta.csc.fi')
   smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, message)
   print("Successfully sent email")
except SMTPException:
   print("Error: unable to send email")
```

* You should replace `sender@domain.com` with your email, or the email you want to receive replies to.
* You should replace as well `destination@domain.com` with the destination email.
* The relay SMTP server will only allow to send emails from clients from certain IPs, like from Rahti 2 nodes. In other words, the script above will not work from your desktop/laptop.
