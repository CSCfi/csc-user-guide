# ARC middleware Overview

The grid computing environment of FGCI is used via the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC) middleware which is produced by the Nordugrid community.
**All tasks and commands are submitted via the middleware and the user
never needs to directly log into the actual computing clusters**. For
this reason FGCI can't be used to run programs interactively. Instead
**the commands to be executed are collected into command files that are
submitted to the FGCI using ARC commands and job description files**.

In this section we provide an introduction to the xRSL (Extended
Resource Specification Language) job description file format and to the
most frequently used ARC middleware commands. More detailed information
about ARC middleware and xRSL files can be found from the manuals
provided by Nordugrid:
