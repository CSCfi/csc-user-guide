# FGCI User Guide Overview

(Version: 6.4. 2014)

Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure (FGCI) is  a distributed Grid and
Cloud computing infrastructure, co-funded by the Academy of Finland and
13 Finnish research institutions  in Finland.

The FGCI will serve as a platform for development of grid and cloud
computing technologies within current computer science research, and at
the same time serve all other fields of science needing computational
resources in Finland, promoting both national and international
collaboration.

**This guide focuses to the usage of FGCI environment as a grid
computing platform.** The IaaS cloud usage of FGCI is done through the
cPouta service of CSC. See [Pouta user guide](../pouts/pouta-what-is.md) for more information. 

See [FGCI DMP](https://research.csc.fi/documents/48467/0/FGCI+Data+Management+Plan/77ceadaa-0866-4530-b2c9-f76a98e891de) for the data management plan.

As a grid computing platform can be seen as an upgrade to its' 
predecessor, FGI. The usage is based on the same components
(ARC middleware and X509 cetificates, and fgi.csc.fi VO) that were in
use in FGI and the two grid generations can be used with same accounts
and commands.

This guide provides the basic information about taking the FGCI service
into use and running simple grid jobs in the FGCI grid.

**Getting Started** 

There are two mandatory preparatory steps that you need to do, to be able to use FGCI.

1.  [Obtain a grid certificate](./fgci-grid-certificates.md)
2.  [Joining to the fgi.csc.fi virtual organisation](./fgci-joining-the-fgi.csc.fi-virtual-organization.md)

In addidtion you must have ARC middleware client installed in the computer, that you will use for submitting and managing grid jobs. (Not that ARC server is not needed)Installataion instructions for ARC middleware can be foud form:
*    [ARC client instructions of Nordugrid](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/users/client_install.html)

These preparatory steps are done just once, when the user starts using FGCI.

This guide provides a general introduction to the FGCI grid environment.
More detailed information as well as tutorials and software specific
instructions can be found from the **FG(C)I web sites**:
