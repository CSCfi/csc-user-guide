# Rahti Templates

Rahti supports templating service deployment code allowing its re-use. The
templates documented here are available to be launched on the Rahti Service
Catalog.

The Service Catalog also lists default templates bundled with OKD which are not
documented here.

## Minio

This template is for deploying a private S3 API supporting object store
[Minio](https://min.io/). The template creates a single pod deployment for
Minio from [minio/minio](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio) public container
image. The application uses a persistent volume as a backend data storage. The
volume size is provided as a template parameter for a newly created persistent
volume. If an existing volume of the given name exists then a new one will not
be created and Rahti will issue an error message but the Minio instance will
still utilize the existing volume. Please follow 
[Minio User Guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html)
for usage of Minio object store.
