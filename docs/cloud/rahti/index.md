Welcome to the Rahti container cloud! Rahti offers several features out of the box. It has an
integrated and configurable **health monitoring** system that allows for fast and automatic **scaling**
and **failover**. Deployment of new versions can be done easily and transparently with the provided
**rolling updates** feature that uses the integrated **load balancing** system. Rahti also provides
default **DNS** names (with the pattern `<something>.rahtiapp.fi`). These domain names have TLS certificates
already installed and always valid. If you are not yet familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
