Welcome to the Rahti container cloud! If you are not yet
familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
the topic:

  * [Background on container orchestration ](/cloud/rahti/introduction/background/)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift,
you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to Rahti:

  * [Getting access ](/cloud/rahti/introduction/access/)

If you already have access to Rahti, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Usage ](/cloud/rahti/usage/getting_started/)
  * [External documentation ](/cloud/rahti/ext_docs/)
