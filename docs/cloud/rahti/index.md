# Rahti container cloud

Welcome to the Rahti container cloud! If you are not yet
familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
the topic:

  * [Background on container orchestration ](/cloud/rahti/introduction/background/)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift,
you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to Rahti:

  * [Getting access ](/cloud/rahti/introduction/access/)

If you already have access to Rahti, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Usage ](/cloud/rahti/usage/getting_started/)
