## Getting access to Rahti

### Login using CSC account

In order to use the Rahti container cloud with a CSC account, you
will need:

1. A CSC user account
2. A computing project with rights to use Rahti

If you already have access to some other CSC computing system like cPouta, Sisu
or Taito then you already have a computing project. You can use the same project
with Rahti as well if you want.

#### Applying for access

You can apply for Rahti access for a computing project in the
My CSC customer portal:

1. Login to [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi) with your CSC account.
2. Go to the [My Projects](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects) page.
3. Select the project for which you want Rahti from the
   projects list.
4. From the list of CSC services, click on Rahti's dropdown menu.
4. Read and accept the *Terms of Use* and press *Apply for access*.
5. CSC will contact you once your application has been accepted.


If you don't have a suitable computing project for your Rahti use, 
you can create one in the the My CSC customer portal.

#### Creating a new computing project

The My CSC customer portal makes it possible to create a new computing project:

1. Login to [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi) with your CSC account.
2. Go to the [My Projects](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects) page.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the
[Create a new project](https://my.csc.fi/myProjects/create-project) button.
4. Give your project a desired name, description, project type and click
on *Create project*.
5. CSC will contact you once your project has been successfully created.
