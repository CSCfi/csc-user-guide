# Webhooks

Webhooks are URLs that allow triggering actions in a system. Rahti supports webhooks to trigger rebuilds. This means that each BuildConfig is listening to a particular URL that includes a secret (more about that later), and that when this URL is called, a build will be triggered for a default branch.

!!! info "Default branch name"

    In Rahti the default branch name is `master`. Branches named otherwise (e.g. GitHub's default value `main`) will be ignored, so make sure that both sides use the same branch name.

There are few types of formats supported: Generic, GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. This means that if the source code of the application is in Gitlab, the Gitlab URL type is the one that should be filled in Gitlab's side.

## Using the command line
First, it is necessary to find the secret, in the BuildConfig (in this case called `serveimg-generate`) look for the GitHub secret:

```bash
oc get bc/serveimg-generate -o yaml
```


```yaml
...
spec:
...
  triggers:
  - github:
      secret: <secret>
    type: GitHub
...
```

When the BuildConfig is configured to be triggered by the webhook, and the
corresponding secret exists, the webhook URL can be found by using the command `oc describe`:

```bash
$ oc describe bc/serveimg-generate
Name:                serveimg-generate
.
.
.
Webhook GitHub:
        URL:        https://rahti.csc.fi:8443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/.../<secret>/github
.
.
.
```

## Using the web interface
In the Application Console, go to **Builds > Builds**, select your build and go to the **Configuration tab**. Find the GitHub URL and copy it:

## Set Webhooks in GitHub

Finally, go to [GitHub](https:///github.com), go to the repository where the code is, and in Settings > Webhooks, click on "Add webhook".

The GitHub WebHook payload URL is the URL above with `<secret>` replaced with the value of `spec.triggers.github[secret]` above, and the content type is `application/json`. Leave the filed `Secret` empty.
