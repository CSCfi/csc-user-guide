3.  Type in the source Git repository containing the content to be
    served. Here, the sample content is used, and the application
    is created in the project _http-test-project_.

4.  Click _Create_. Navigate to the newly created
    project: ![new-project](img/click-project.png)

    Select _Overview_ in the menu on the left.

5.  Now, the OpenShift dashboard should display information about the application.
    This application is available at 
    [httpd-example-http-test-project.rahtiapp.fi](http://httpd-example-http-test-project. rahtiapp.fi)

OpenShift processed a template that provisioned
various objects, such as *Pods*, *Services*, *Routes*, *DeploymentConfigs*, and
*Builds* into the container cloud, and as a result, a web server emerged.

For deeper insight in to the created objects, please see:

* [Core objects](elemental_tutorial.md) for introduction to the fundamental objects on
  which OpenShift/Kubernetes applications are built upon.
* Kubernetes and OpenShift [Concepts](../concepts.md) for how managing applications in
  OpenShift/Kubernetes is further streamlined using higher abstraction level objects.
