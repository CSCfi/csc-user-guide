# Creating, converting, uploading and sharing virtual machine images

This article explains how to manage images in Pouta.

[TOC]

## Creating images

There are two different options for creating new virtual machine
images: creating the image from scratch, and launching a virtual machine
based on an existing image, making modifications on the running
machine and saving the changes as a new image by creating a snapshot.

### Creating an image based on an existing image

Launch a virtual machine using one of the available images either
through the Horizon web interface or through the command line
interface. 

Launching an instance on the command line:

    openstack server create --flavor <flavor> \
    --image <image uuid> \
    --key-name <key name> \
    --nic net-id=<name of network> \
    --security-group default \
    --security-group <additional security group> <name of server>

Login and make any necessary changes. To ensure consistent snapshots,
snapshots should only be created from instances which are powered off.
First power off your instance:

    openstack server stop <name of vm>

Then create a snapshot of the machine's current state:

    openstack server image create --name <name of snapshot to create> <name of vm>

It takes some time to create the snapshot. Once it is finished,
it appears as a new image. If you need the original instance, you
can power it on after the snapshot has been created.

    openstack server start <name of vm>

In the web UI under **Compute \| Instances**, the instance-specific
Create Snapshot menu items work for the same effect as the CLI
command above. The snapshots created will appear in the **Compute \|
Images** section.

### Creating an image from scratch

There are a number of tools for creating images from scratch. These
tools can be categorized into tools that involve running an operating
system in a virtual machine for setting up the image and tools
that take a base image and make modifications to it without running a
virtual machine. We will call these "installation-based tools" and
"base image tools".

The generic workflow when using installation-based tools:

1. Obtain an installation media or a network installation link.
2. Start a virtual machine and point it to the installation media or
 network installation link.
3. Go through the installer.
 - This step can optionally be automated using e.g. [Kickstart].
4. After the installation is finished, shut down the VM and use
 additional tools to prepare the image for cloud use.

The generic workflow when using base image tools:

1. Optionally customize configuration files that are used to generate
 the final image.
2. Determine the suitable customization parameters.
3. Run a command to generate the final image.

You can get more information about creating images in the very
thorough [OpenStack virtual machine image guide]. In particular, see
the chapters on [creating images manually] and [tool support for creating
images].

#### Caveats to keep in mind when creating images from scratch

These caveats usually only need to be considered when using
installation-based methods of image creation. The tools that use base
images are usually specifically designed to create images for clouds,
so they take care of these caveats for you. If you decide to use an
installation-based method of image creation, you should look into the
excellent [virt-sysprep] tool that takes care of most
modifications necessary for cloud use with a single command line
command. This chapter lists some of the caveats that need to be
handled before an image is ready for clouds.

#### cloud-init

There is a tool called [cloud-init] that must be installed on any
images that are to be used in Pouta clouds. It is used for certain
tasks that need to be run when a virtual machine first boots up
such as **generating SSH host keys and adding
user SSH public keys.**

#### User accounts (can be done with [virt-sysprep])

Cloud images should only have a minimal set of user accounts. Most
likely, they should only have one regular generic user account (e.g.
"cloud-user" on the default images provided by CSC) and the root user
account.

#### SSH host keys (can be done with [virt-sysprep])

Images used in the cloud must not contain any SSH host keys, as having
them in the image would mean that every server launched using the
image would have the same identity from the point of view of SSH. It
is also a security risk, as anyone with access to the image file would
be able to personate any server launched using that image file. Fresh
SSH host keys need to be generated by _cloud-init_ (see above) when a
virtual machine first boots up.

#### Network interface ordering (can be done with [virt-sysprep])

The _udev_ device manager in the Linux kernel has a function that 
pins a specific network interface name to a specific MAC address. This
is not good if several virtual machines are to be created from an
image, as all virtual machines will have different MAC
addresses. It is also not good if you create a snapshot out of a
virtual machine and try to use that snapshot to launch a virtual
machine, as it will remember the MAC address of the old virtual
machine that was used to create the snapshot. The best way to do this
is to use _virt-sysprep_.

#### Partitioning

When partitioning a Linux image, you should make sure the root
partition is the first and only partition. During the virtual machine
bootup process, OpenStack inserts SSH keys on the first partition
under the /root/.ssh directory, which means this partition must be the
root partition and not e.g. /boot. Logging in is not be possible
without the root password unless the keys are correctly inserted.

#### ACPI daemon

The ACPI daemon is used to receive commands to manage the power state
of a virtual machine. You should install an ACPI daemon on the machine
images to allow proper power down/reboot in the cloud interface.

#### Hotplug

To be able to use volumes, you need to have *ACPI hotplug*
enabled. This is on by default in CentOS 6 and newer, but for Ubuntu,
you need to add the line "*acpiphp*" to */etc/modules*. For other
distros, please check how to load *acpiphp* on boot from the distro
documentation.


## Converting images

When performing a snapshot of a virtual machine, OpenStack creates an 
image in _raw_ format. These images typically take as many GB as the 
capacity of the root disk of the virtual machine, regardless of the 
amount of GB actually used by the customer. As a result, taking 
snapshots can quickly deplete the space available for images.

A solution to this problem is to convert the image obtained from the 
snapshot to more compact formats, such as _qcow2_, which stores the 
customer data only. To do so, we download the raw image, we convert it 
to qcow2, and we upload the newly obtained image to OpenStack. Given 
that raw images can take many GB, we do not recommend performing this 
operation on a personal computer, but to use an auxiliary virtual 
machine within Pouta instead. In the following, we illustrate the 
procedure using a temporary virtual machine.

1) We assume we have just performed a snapshot of a virtual machine, 
and we have thus obtained an image _myVmSnapshot_. The first step is to 
create a temporary virtual machine that we will use to convert 
myVmSnapshot. The virtual machine should have enough space to host 
myVmSnapshot and its compact version at the same time. Since the 
compact version will be smaller or of equal size of myVmSnapshot, 
a safe choice is to select a flavor that is capable of hosting two times 
the size of myVmSnapshot. For example, if myVmSnapshot has a size of 
80GB, a suitable flavor for the auxiliary virtual machine is io.160GB 
because it has 160 GB of ephemeral storage. The operating system can be 
CentOS-7, for example.

    openstack server create --flavor <flavor> \
    --image <image uuid> \
    --key-name <key name> \
    --nic net-id=<name of network> \
    --security-group default \
    --security-group <additional security group> snapshotConverter

The only additional requirements for the setting up of the virtual 
machine are i) attaching a public floating IP, and ii) enabling SSH, so that 
we can actually log into the virtual machine.

2) Once the virtual machine is up and running, we copy the OpenStack 
RC File v3 for accessing to cPouta/ePouta in the virtual machine. If you 
do not have such file yet, please refer to [this 
guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/install-client/#configure-your-terminal-environment-for-openstack) 
to obtain a copy.

    scp <project_name_here>-openrc.sh cloud-user@<floating_ip>:/home/cloud-user/

Login into the virtual machine and use the file to load your 
credentials.

    source <project_name_here>-openrc.sh

3) In order to host the image obtained from the snapshot, we need to 
initialize properly the ephemeral storage. To do so, please refer to [our 
guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/ephemeral-storage/). After this 
step, we assume the ephemeral disk is mounted in _/mnt_.

4) Next, we need to equip the virtual machine with some basic tools we 
will need.

    sudo yum install python3 python3-virtualenv screen qemu-img

We create a python-3 virtual environment, which we will use to interact 
with cPouta/ePouta, and we enter in it.

    virtualenv-3 env
    source env/bin/activate

Now we install the actual tools we need to talk with cPouta/ePouta.

    pip install python-openstackclient==3.11.0 openstacksdk==0.9.17 os-client-config==1.27.0 osc-lib==1.6.0

5) Next, we download the image we obtained taking the snapshot. Move to 
the ephemeral storage directory.

    cd /mnt

Though it is not required, at this point we recommend opening a _screen_ 
session, which allows to keep a process running in background, i.e., 
without the need of waiting for its completion before closing the 
terminal.

    screen -S converter

We now issue the command to download the image obtained from the 
snapshot.

    openstack image save --file myVmSnapshotRaw.raw <id_of_myVmSnapshot>

Given the size of the image, the process will take few minutes. We can 
exit the screen session by pressing CTRL+A followed by CTRL+D. We can 
re-enter the screen session any time typing:

    screen -r converter

6) Once the previous command has finished, it is time to convert the 
image.

    qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 myVmSnapshotRaw.raw myVmSnapshotQcow2.qcow2

As previously mentioned, the qcow2 format will store only the actual 
customer data instead of storing a 1-to-1 copy of the root disk. If the 
size of the customer data is considerably smaller than the total 
capacity of the root disk, similarly the qcow2 image will be 
considerably smaller than the raw image.

7) Once the conversion is completed, the new image can be uploaded to 
OpenStack.

    openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --file myVmSnapshotQcow2.qcow2 myVmSnapshotCompact 

If the operation is successful, we can remove the image in raw format from OpenStack.

    openstack image delete <id_of_myVmSnapshot>

We may keep the auxiliary virtual machine for future image conversions, 
or delete it right after its usage.

    openstack server delete <id_of_snapshotConverter>

## Uploading images

You can upload images either using the web interface or the
_openstack_ command line tool.

Before uploading, you need to know what format the image you are
uploading is. The most likely options are _qcow2_ and _raw_. You can
find out the type of the image using the _file_ command. This is what
a qcow2 image looks like:

~~~~
$ file images/Ubuntu-15.10-Phoronix.qcow2
images/Ubuntu-15.10-Phoronix.qcow2: Qemu Image, Format: Qcow (v3), 10737418240 bytes
~~~~

And this is what a raw image looks like:

~~~~
$ file images/Ubuntu-14.04-old.raw
images/Ubuntu-14.04-old.raw: x86 boot sector; partition 1: ID=0x83, active, starthead 0, startsector 16065, 20948760 sectors, code offset 0x63
~~~~

Upload using the command line:

    openstack image create --disk-format <disk format> --private --file <image file to upload> <name of image to create>

This should upload the image. It takes a while before the image is usable.

If you prefer to use the web interface instead, you can upload images
in the **Compute \| Images** section by clicking the **Create
Image** button:

![Image upload](/img/horizon-image-upload2.png)

You will be presented with this dialog:

![Image upload dialog](/img/horizon-image-upload-dialog.png)

In this dialog, for example, we are creating an image called
_Alpine-linux_. You can optionally add an **Image Description** for
the image, if you need it for your reference. Due to security
concerns, we support image uploads only via your local machine, and
image upload via public URLs is disabled. In this example, we have
thus selected an image we want to upload from our local machine via the
**Browse** button. In this example, our image is an ISO image, so we
have selected that in the **Format** drop-down menu. All remaining
fields other than **Image Sharing \| Visibility** can keep their
default values. In the **Image Sharing \| Visibility** checkbox, please
make sure that you have set the visibility of the image as
_Private_. It is not possible for normal users to create public images
due to security reasons. In case you attempt to upload an image and
set its visibility as _Public_, you will get an error message. Setting
your image visibility to _Private_ will make your uploaded image
private to your particular OpenStack project, and only the members
of your project can access it.

## Sharing images between Pouta projects

You can share images between different Pouta projects using the
command line tools. Image sharing between projects is currently not
supported using the Pouta web interface. Once shared, the image will be
visible in both projects, i.e. between the donor and acceptor
projects.

Please note that image sharing works within the same cloud environment, i.e. you
can share images from one cPouta project to another but not between a
cPouta project and ePouta project or vice versa. 

To begin with, you need to first make sure the image is of the shared variant
if it isn't already:

    openstack image set --shared <your-image-UUID>

Then, initiate the share by executing the following _openstack_ command in the
donor project: 

    openstack image add project <your-image-UUID> <acceptor-project-UUID>

Then the acceptor project needs to accept this membership. To do so,
you or your colleague needs to execute the following glance command in the
acceptor project:

```
openstack image set --accept <your-image-UUID>
