# OpenStack commandline tool installation using package manager tools

This article describes how to install the OpenStack command line tools on 
Ubuntu,  Red  Hat  and  OS  X  based  systems 
to effienctly manage various features of OpenStack.
Installation instructions are based on Python's pip package. Once pip is
in place, the steps are the same for all systems.

!!! note
    If you don't have root/administrator access
    to the system  on which you want  to run the command  line clients on,
    see    the    instructions    about   [virtual environments below](#optional-installation-in-a-python-virtual-environment)

Installation under Windows  is also possible, but is  beyond the scope
of    this   guide.    Rackspace    maintains   a    guide   for [Installing python-novaclient on Windows](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-python-novaclient-on-windows)

We recommend first familiarizing the [Pouta web GUI](launch-vm-from-web-gui.md) and main concepts.

## Overview of OpenStack command line tools

There  is a  generic command   line tool  called "openstack"
that can  be used  to manage  most things in  OpenStack and  there are
individual tools  for managing  only some specific  functionalities of
OpenStack  like  "neutron"  for  managing networks  and  "glance"  for
managing virtual machine  images.  In most cases  the common openstack
tool should be  used. The other tools are deprecated  by the OpenStack
project  and are  generally only  necessary if  you have  scripts that
depend   on  them   or  you   need  to   run  certain   administrative
commands.

| Tool name | Package name | Used for |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| openstack | python-openstackclient | Managing all of OpenStack                                                                      |
| nova      | python-novaclient      | Managing virtual machines and some limited functionality for managing e.g. volumes and images. |
| neutron   | python-neutronclient   | Managing virtual networks and routers.                                                         |
| glance    | python-glanceclient    | Managing virtual machine images.                                                               |
| cinder    | python-cinderclient    | Managing volumes that can be attached to virtual machines.                                     |
| swift     | python-swiftclient     | Managing objects with the Swift API                                                            |



### Preparation

To prepare the installation of the  actual command line tools, we will
install pip and Python development packages. 

!!! note
    We assume here  that you already have Python  installed. This is
    most likely the  case if you are running any  of the operating systems
    for which  we have instructions  here.

 You can  find out if  Python is installed and what version it is by typing this in a shell:

~~~~
python --version
~~~~

You will need Python 2.7 or newer in order to install the command line
client tools. If  you are running even a relatively  recent version of
your operating  system, this should not  be an issue. However,  if you
have a Red Hat based system that is older than version 7, you won't be
able  to  install  Python  2.7  the  normal  way.  See  the  note  for
RHEL/CentOS 6 users under the corresponding subheading below.

If for some reason you don't  have Python installed, please install it
first by following [these instructions].

#### Preparation: Ubuntu based systems

If running Ubuntu 16.04 or newer:

~~~~
sudo apt install python-pip python-dev
~~~~

For versions older than 16.04:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev

#### Preparation: Red Hat based systems

If running version 7 or newer:

    sudo yum install python-pip python-devel

!!! note

    If  you  are running  RHEL/CentOS  6,  the  latest version  of  Python
    available by default is 2.6. This is too old to run recent versions of
    the OpenStack client  tools. It is possible to install  Python 2.7 for
    these operating systems as well, but that  is out of the scope of this
    guide.  You can  find information on how to install  Python 2.7 on the
    [SoftwareCollections.org] web page. Once  you've done that, you should
    be able  to follow the  instructions for  newer Red Hat  based systems
    above.

#### Preparation: OS X systems

Download   latest  [puthon setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)"

Install the tools and pip:

    sudo python ez_setup.py
    sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install pip

### Installing the openstack tool (all operating systems)

From this point onwards the installation instructions are the same for
all operating systems.

#### Optional: Installation in a Python virtual environment

If  you  also run  other  Python
software besides the OpenStack command line tools on your computer, we
recommend using Python's virtual environments. </span>Python's virtual
environments are  a way to create  an isolated set of  Python packages
that are  only available  in that virtual  environment. They  are very
convenient   for   keeping   your  Python   installation   clean   and
manageable. You will also need to use  them if you wish to install the
command line  client tools on a  computer where you don't  have a root
access. In that  case your administrator will need  to install Python,
pip and  the virtualenv Python  package for you. For  more information
about virtual environments, see [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python].

Here we  will give basic instructions  on setting up a  simple virtual
environment for installing the client tools.  If you don't want to use
virtual environments, you  can skip these  steps and move  directly to
the installation instructions using pip.

First install the virtualenv Python package:

    sudo pip install virtualenv

You can also  use the packages provided by your  operating system, for
example  on   Red  Hat   you  could  install   python-virtualenv  with
yum. Create  a directory for your  virtual environments. We give  it a
specific name but you can call it something else as well:

    mkdir python_virtualenvs

Go  to  the directory  and  create  a  new virtual  environment  using
virtualenv:

    cd python_virtualenvs
    virtualenv osclient

This   creates   a  new   directory   called   "osclient"  under   the
"python\_virtualenvs"   directory.   This   directory   will   contain
everything  you  install  within  the  virtual  environment.  It  also
contains a script for activating the  environment that you need to run
next:

    source osclient/bin/activate

After activation, further Python or
pip commands  will run in the  context of the virtual  environment. If
you now proceed with the installation instructions below, all packages
will be installed in your  newly created virtual environment. You will
know that the "osclient" virtual environment is activated when you see
the  text  "(osclient)"  before  your  prompt in  the  shell  you  are
using.  If you  install  the  command line  clients  inside a  virtual
environment,  they   will  only  be  available   within  that  virtual
environment.

After installation, if you want to deactivate the virtual environment,
you can simply type:

    deactivate

Note that doing this will also mean that any of the command line tools
you  install won't  be  available  for use  until  you reactivate  the
virtual environment.

#### Installing the client tools using pip

OpenStack provides a set of  Python tools for managing various aspects
of its operation. Each subcomponent  of OpenStack has its own tool. It
also      provides      a      common     shared      tool      called
*python-openstackclient*. The easiest  way to install the  most of the
command line  tools is  to install python-openstackclient.   It should
pull several  other clients as  dependencies.  If  a tool you  need is
missing even after installing  python-openstackclient, please refer to
the table  at the  beginning of this  page for a  list of  packages to
install.

!!! note
    If you  followed the  instructions for  setting up  a virtual
    environment,  remove the  "sudo" from  the beginning  of the  commands
    below.  As you are installing in  your own virtual environment, you do
    not want to run the commands as root.**

You can install python-openstackclient with pip like so:

    sudo pip install python-openstackclient

If you also  want to install all the service  specific tools listed at
the beginning of this page, run this:

    sudo pip install python-keystoneclient python-novaclient python-glanceclient python-neutronclient

Depending  on  your  computer's  setup,  some  dependencies  might  be
missing.    An   error   message   "ImportError:   No   module   named
&lt;module&gt;" can usually be fixed  by installing the missing module
with pip  and then  repeating the previous,  failed command.  For some
errors  during installation,  updating setuptools  or pip  might help,
upgrading a package can be done with:

    sudo pip install -U python_module_to_be_upgraded

### Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack

Environment  variables  need  to  be   set  before  you  can  use  the
client. You can set them using a script provided through the OpenStack
web interface.   You can download  this script form the  following URL
after logging in:

> <a
> href="https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/"
> class="external-link">https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/</a>

To  download this  from within  the  web interface,  navigate to  this
*Access & Security* screen, and press *Download OpenStack RC File v3.*

![RC file example](/img/rc-file-example20190121-b.png)

Once you  have the  openrc script  from the  web UI,  you can  add the
environment variables by typing this into a terminal:

    source <project_name_here>-openrc.sh

### 

You will be asked to type in a password. Use the password for your CSC
account.   Note that  using  Haka credentials  with  the command  line
interface is not yet supported. After doing this, the current terminal
session  will have  the  proper environment  variables  for using  the
command line tools. You  will need to do this again if  you open a new
terminal.
