## What is Pouta?

cPouta and  ePouta are the  IaaS clouds  services at CSC.   The cPouta
cloud  is  the  public  cloud   which  is  easily  accessible via  the
internet. The ePouta  cloud is virtual private cloud  designed to meet
the security  requirements for handling sensitive  data.   Both cPouta
and  ePouta clouds run  on OpenStack  cloud software. The  Pouta cloud
services are suitable  for most kinds of  computational workloads, and
any other supporting services these workloads might need.

cPouta virtual machines can be connected to the external IP addresses,
and in this case they can be directly accessed from the Internet. This
helps the customers run widely  available services, but customers must
also take care  to secure their machines. The virtual  machines do not
have access to any other part of CSC's infrastructure, other than what
is already visible to the Internet. Application data and software must
be  uploaded either  via the  internet or  copied from  CSC's existing
shared
storage services.  
  
ePouta  cloud services  are  well suited  for computational  workloads
involving sensitive data  as well as extending  customer's existing IT
infrastructure.  ePouta  cloud  services are  attached  to  customer's
infrastructure and could  be used to analyse sensitive  data which may
require large amounts  of memory or clustered  I/O performance, remote
desktop for processing of sensitive data etc.. The virtual machines in
ePouta cloud may optionally have  network access to specific sensitive
data repositories at CSC.
