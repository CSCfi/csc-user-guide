# MariaDB


* [How to access your MariaDB database](mariadb-accessing.md)
* [How to create database users and modify user permissions](mariadb-permissions.md)

TODO I would like out documentation to manetion how the backup works in the background e.g. 
  * pg_basebackup is compressed encrypted and streamed to Allas
  * mariadbbackup is compressed encyrpted and streamed to Allas

TODO We should add some links to mariadb documentation from here maybe these:
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-client/
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sql-statements-structure/
TODO postgreql.md would also benefit of similar links
