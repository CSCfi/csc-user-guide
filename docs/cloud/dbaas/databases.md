!!! error "Closed Beta"
    Pukki DBaaS is in closed beta. This means that the service is probably not suitable for most users
    and there might be breaking changes. If you are still interested in using the service you can
    [contact us](../../support/contact.md) to see if the service would be suitable for you.

Currently Pukki only supports PostgreSQL. If you think that Pukki should support some specific
database type please [contact us](../../support/contact.md) with your suggestions.
