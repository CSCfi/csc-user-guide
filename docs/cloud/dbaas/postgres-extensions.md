# PostgreSQL extensions

## Enabling extensions

  1. [Enable the root user](operations.md#enable-root).
  2. [Log in to the database as root](postgres-accessing.md#command-line).
  3. Use the following command to enable extensions:
    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION $EXTENSION_NAME ;
    ```
  4. Disable root once you're done enabling extensions.

## Currently available extensions

If there are extensions missing here that you would like to see available in Pukki, please contact the [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).
Note that the extension list is based on the latest PostgreSQL version, the available extensions might differ in older versions.

<!-- This extension list can easily be generated with the following command:
SELECT '| ' || name  AS name, comment || ' |' as comment FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;

## Parameters that users can modify

The DBaaS allows users to modify some of the parameters.
If there are some parameters that you think you should be able to modify, [please contact us](../../support/contact.md) and we'll see if we can make it possible.
By default, we assume that default parameters are sane and that users should not, under normal circumstances, modify any of these parameters.

| Parameters           | Default | Requires restart | Comments |
|:--- |:---:|:---|:---|
| maintenance_work_mem | 64MB  | No  | |
| max_connections      | 100   | Yes |It is usually recommended to use connection pools instead of modifying this value |
| work_mem             | 4MB   | No  | |
| log_statement        | false | No  | This is useful if you want to figure out more how your database is utilized |
| log_statement_stats  | false | No  |This will also collect stats from your database, this is recommended to keep as false since it might affect performance |
