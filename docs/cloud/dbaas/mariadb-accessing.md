# Accessing your MariaDB instance
!!! warning "MariaDB in Pukki is still in beta"
    This means that we have not tested as extensively that everything works correctly and there
    might still be big changes how Pukki will manage MariaDB databases. We are hoping to be able
    to get out of beta in March 2025.

## Graphical user interface
You can find a non-comprehensive list of different graphical interfaces for using MariaDB on
[MariaDB's homepage](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/graphical-and-enhanced-clients/)


## Command-line client mariadb and mysql
[https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-command-line-client/]

Nowadays the recommend client to use is `mariadb` , `mysql` does still work but it usually a
symbolic link to `mariadb`
