Welcome to the Rahti 2 container cloud! Rahti 2 offers several features out of the box. It has an
integrated and configurable **health monitoring** system that allows fast and automatic **scaling**
and **failover**. Deployments of new version can be easily done transparently with the provided
**rolling updates** features that use the integrated **load balancing** system. Rahti 2 also provides
default **DNS** names (With the pattern <something>.rahtiapp.fi). These domain names have TLS certificates
already installed and always valid. If you are not yet familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
