Rahti 2 offers out of the box a catalog of applications and components of applications (like databases). In addition to that, CSC adds a selected group of applications to the catalog. These applications are provided "as is". We follow the updates provided by Redhat, the upstream provider. We are not able to proactively update them on our own. If you need help to deploy a newer version of an application, please contact the Service Desk on the address <servicedesk@csc.fi>. Each request is studied individually.

For more information, you can access The official GitHub repository for the [default Openshift Helm Charts](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts)

Regarding templates, you can find the GitHub repository here: [Openshift default templates](https://github.com/sclorg/)


## How to access the catalog using the WebUI

You can browse the catalog from the webinterface after (1) logging in Rahti 2 and then (2) switching to the Developer view and click in `+Add`.

!!! warning "Not all Rahti 1 templates have been ported to Rahti 2"

    The process of adapting and testing the templates to Rahti 2 is labor intensive and not in the top of our task list. If you have any special interest on the functionality provided by a Rahti 1 template that is missing in Rahti 2 please let us know (<servicedesk@csc.fi>).
