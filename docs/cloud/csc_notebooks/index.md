# CSC Notebooks

[CSC Notebooks](https://notebooks.csc.fi){target="_blank"} offers web applications for self-learning, hosting courses 
and collaboration. The applications are accessed through a web browser and run in CSC cloud. You can log
in with your Haka/Virtu/CSC customer account. We support Jupyter and RStudio based applications, with more options to 
come in the future.

!!!Note 

    This documentation describes the upcoming new release that is currently available as **public beta** at
    [notebooks-beta.rahtiapp.fi](https://notebooks-beta.rahtiapp.fi){target="_blank"}

## Who and how can CSC notebooks be used?

1. [As student](guide_for_students.md): participating to a self-learning or a tutored course.
2. [As teacher](guide_for_teachers.md): hosting a course
3. As researcher: [participating to a course or collaboration project](guide_for_students.md) or [setting up CSC Notebooks as collaboration platform](guide_for_teachers.md)

## Concepts

To better understand the CSC Notebooks environment, we have collected all terms and concepts in a separate [concepts](concepts.md) document.

## Data persistence

CSC Notebooks provides different ways of sharing (e.g. course contents) and storing (e.g. students own progress) data. For an explanation of the different possibilities, see the separate document on [data persistence](data_persistence.md).

## Summary of changes and improvements in beta

See the separate [migration to beta](migration_to_beta.md) document.
