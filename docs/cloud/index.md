# Overview

CSC offers a variety of cloud computing services: Pouta services (cPouta and ePouta) and Rahti container cloud service.

Pouta services are provided in a Infrastructure-as-a-Service model. Using Pouta services, you can can take control of your IT infrastructure, manage it in a flexible fashion, and automate it as you require. You can launch and manage virtual machines, deploy storage, and create networks for your needs. cPouta is targeted towards generic cloud needs, while ePouta is mainly used for handling sensitive data. Taking ePouta into use requires more set-up and always involves your organization's IT department.

Rahti makes the deployment of applications a breeze. This is a higher level service than Pouta services, and Rahti automatically takes care of a lot of the lower level management, so that you don't have to. Rahti is based on Red Hat's OKD, which is a distribution of Kubernetes. It uses Docker containers to run applications.[^1]

### Pouta

With Pouta services, you can can take control of your IT infrastructure, manage it in a flexible fashion, and automate it as you require. You can launch and manage virtual machines, deploy storage, and create networks for your needs. This infrastructure can be used for anything you need or can imagine.[^2]

### Rahti

Rahti makes the deployment of applications a breeze. This is a higher level service than Pouta services, and Rahti automatically takes care of a lot of the lower level management, so that you don't have to.

Like cPouta, Rahti is a generic platform that can run many different kinds of applications from web servers and databases to complex scientific software stacks and data analysis pipelines. However, in contrast to cPouta where you manage infrastructure like virtual machines and networks, in Rahti you manage applications directly. You can think of it as a big computer where you launch applications, whereas cPouta is like a data center where you add your own computers.[^2]

### CSC Notebooks

Notebooks is a cloud platform instantly ready for use. It is especially well-suited for teaching and research. Notebooks provides easy-to-use environments for programming and working with data. 

Different environments based on Jupyter Notebook, RStudio Server and Apache Spark are available via Notebooks.[^3]
