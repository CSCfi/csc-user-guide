# Noppe

[Noppe](https://noppe.csc.fi){target="_blank"} (previously CSC Notebooks) offers web applications for self-learning, hosting courses 
and collaboration. The applications are accessed through a web browser and run in CSC cloud. You can log
in with your Haka/Virtu/CSC customer account. We support Jupyter and RStudio based applications, with more options to 
come in the future.

## Who and how can Noppe be used?

1. [As student](guide_for_students.md): participating to a self-learning or a tutored course.
2. [As teacher](guide_for_teachers.md): hosting a course
3. As researcher: [participating to a course or collaboration project](guide_for_students.md) or [setting up Noppe as collaboration platform](guide_for_teachers.md)

## Concepts

To better understand the Noppe environment, we have collected all terms and concepts in 
a separate [concepts](concepts.md) document.

## Data persistence

Noppe provides different ways of sharing (e.g. course contents) and storing (e.g. students own progress) data. For an explanation of the different possibilities, see the separate document on [data persistence](data_persistence.md).

## Summary of changes and improvements since previous major version

See the ["What's new" section for cloud services](../../support/whats-new.md).
