Here we have some body text [with a link](https://example.com). **Some of it is boldfaced**, *some italicized*. `Some might be monospace`.
> There's even text in a blockquote.

Let's make an ordered list:

1. An item on a list
1. Another item
1. Even a third item

Here is an unordered list:

- It has an item
- Another item
- And yet another item

```python
# Here is a box with some syntax highlighted code

from somewhere import some_code


class PythonClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__property = "A string property"
    
    @property
    def property(self):
        return __property

    @classmethod
    def method(parameter):
        return [None] * parameter
```

Oh, look! Here's a horizontal rule:

!!! Important

    This is some very important text. It is rendered in an important box.
