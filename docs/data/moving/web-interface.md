# Moving files using the Puhti web interface

!!! warning "Note"
    Uploaded files will overwrite existing files with the same name without
    prompting. Currently the maximum size for individual file uploads is 10 GB.

Files *on Puhti* can be uploaded and downloaded through the file browser of the
[Puhti web interface](../../computing/webinterface/index.md). The file browser
can be opened from the Files menu in the top navigation bar (this displays a
list of all project disk areas you have access to).

**In the file browser you can:**

* Upload files (drag&drop or by browsing your local folders)
* Download files
* Manage files within Puhti (copy/move/edit/delete)
* Create new files/directories
* Open a command-line shell in the current directory
