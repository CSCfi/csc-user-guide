# 4. Using MySQL client through batch job system

The MySQL client program can be used in the batch job systems in the same way as in interactive client usage. The only difference is that in the batch jobs, the database password can't be given interactively. Instead it should be given by using MySQL configuration file (_.my.cnf_) in the home directory.

Below is a sample MySQL script for Puhti. First we need to create a MySQL connection configuration file that locates in the home directory.  In this case we use user account _mydb1_admin_, whose password is _abc123_.  The file, named as _.my.cnf_ , would now look like following:
 
```text
[client]
user =  mydb1_admin
password = abc123
host = kaivos.csc.fi
```

Then we create the actual batch job script. The script below reserves 12 h time and 1 GB memory to run the MySQL query that is defined in the file _query_commands.sql_. The query is made to database _mydb1_ and the connection parameters are read from file _.my.cnf_ . The results are written to the _results.txt_ file.
```text
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=mysql_job
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#SBATCH --account=project_example
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024

module load mysql
cd $WRKDIR/my_data

mysql --local mydb1 <query_commands.sql > results.txt
```
 
## Example : Using MySQL database from a batch job script in Puhti

The MySQL database in kaivos.csc.fi is intended for cases where computing servers of CSC use the MySQL database to store and analyze data. In these cases the database is normally not used interactively, but the MySQL client is used automatically from a shell or program script. 

Below is a a sample mysql session where database called _DB_A_ is accessed using the database user account _DB_A_admin_  and password _abc123_.  
In Puhti the command is run under project: project_2000136. The database user account information is first stored into _.my.cnf_ in home directory:

```text
[client]
user =  DB_A_admin
password = abc123
host = kaivos.csc.fi
```

Below is a sample batch job script, called as kaivos.bash,  that utilizes kaivos.csc.fi within the batch queue system.

```text
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job.name=mysql_job
#SBATCH --output=output_%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#SBATCH --account=project_2000136
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024
#load mysql environment
module load mysql

#go to the right directory
cd datadir

# run the analysis
my_program < inputfile30.data > results.30

#feed the data to the database
mysqlimport --local --compress DB_A results.30

#change the status value in the dataset_table
mysql --local DB_A <<EOF
   update dataset_table set status="done" where name="inputfile30.data" ;
EOF

#remove the original results file
rm -f results.30

```

The sample script above first analyzes a file called _inputfile30.data_ with program _my_program_. The results are first written to file called _results.30_ . The data in this file is then imported to a database with _mysqlimport_ command. Note that the script assumes that a table called _results_ already exists in the database _DB_A_ and that the columns in the results file are in the same order as in the database table.

After importing the data to the database the script launches another MySQL command. The second command modifies an existing table called _dataset_table_. The mysql command changes the status value in this table so that in the row where the _name_ column contains the value _inputfile30.data_, the _status_ column gets the value:  _done_ .

The _kaivos.bash_ script, described above, can be submitted to the batch job system of Taito with command
```text
sbatch kaivos.bash
```
