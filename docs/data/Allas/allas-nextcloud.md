# Using Nextcloud as front end for Allas storage system

Motivation: Allas is a general purpose storage system for research data. 
It can be used with tools based on Swift and S3 protocols. However, in many cases, 
using Allas directly trough S3 or Swift is limited by the rather plain structure 
of user management and by the fact that the access is based on personal CSC user accounts.

Using Nextcloud server as a front end allows you to create and manage your own user 
base for your Allas storage area and control the access to different datasets and storage areas. 
Further, Nextcloud provides several user interfaces (including a WWW-interface and a cell phone app) 
that are often easier to use and more flexible to use that native Swift or S3 applications.

In this document we show a simple use case with the following steps:

   1. Launch a new Ubuntu18 Virtual Machine
   2. Install a Nextcloud server into the new VM
   3. Link The Nextcloud server is linked to a data bucket in Allas
   4. New Nextcloud user account is created for an external user

## 1. Launch a new Ubuntu18 Virtual Machine

First, launch a new Ubuntu18 based server in cPouta service. 
See instructions in the [cPouta documentation](../../../cloud/pouta/) and
in [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvoN4pv0RJQ).

In most cases the combination of “standard small” flavor and Ubuntu18.04 image is sufficient.

When you create the security group for the VM, the instructions above show how 
port 22 is opened for ssh access. In this case, use the same procedure to open 
port 443 (https), too, as it will be used to access the Nextcloud server.


## 2. Setting up a Next Cloud sever in the VM

Open a terminal connection to your server (ssh or Putty) to install the Nextcloud server.
First, it is good to update the Ubuntu system:

```text
sudo apt-get update
```
In this example we use _snap_ as it provides an easy way to install Nextcloud.
You can do the installations with just few commands:

```text
sudo snap install nextcloud
sudo nextcloud.enable-https self-signed
```
The latter command enables https with self signed certificate that is sufficient for testing. 
For production you should use real certificates (e.g. lets-encrypt instead of self-signed)

The Nextcloud server is now up and running, but you are not yet able to access is.

To enable remote access you need to edit the configuration file of your Nextcloud server. 
In this case the file is in the standard location defined by snap. You can open it 
for editing with command:

```text
sudo nano /var/snap/nextcloud/current/nextcloud/config/config.php
```
In the config file, find the trusted_domains specification and add the IP-address of 
your Nextcloud server to the list of trusted domains (this is the Floating IP address 
that you assigned for the VM in the puhti and that you used to open the terminal connection). 
For example the case of IP:86.50.252.77 the definition should look like

```text
  'trusted_domains' => 
   array (
    0 => '127.0.0.1',
    1 => '86.50.252.77',
  ),
```

Now you should be able to connect your Nextcoud server running in _https://ip-of-your-VM_

So in this example: _https://86.50.252.77_


When the connection to the server is made for the first time, the WWW interface asks the 
first user to define admin account and password. That account will be used in the future 
to manage the Nextcloud server. Due to this you should first use a security group that 
allows access to the 443 port only from your own computer and define the admin account 
immediately after starting the server. Once the admin account is defined you can allow 
other sites to access the https port.


If the connection web interface fails check that:

*   you are using the right protocol and ip address
*   port number 443 and your local IP address (not the server IP) is defined in the cPouta security group and that this security group is in use
*   your browser accepts self-signed certificates
 

Nextcloud software is modular, it can be extended with Nextcloud Apps. Once you have the
Nextcloud up and running, it is a good practise to check what Apps are enabled and how
different features are configured to work. You can do this in the Nextcloud user interface
when you are loggind in as admin. If you wish, you can also start this by running a CSC
provided script that disables a few and configures some Apps in order to make the Nextcloud
less overloaded with features for this kind of Allas front end testing. The script can be
downloaded and run like this:

```text
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/nextcloud_snap/clean_nextcloud_snap >clean_nextcloud_snap
chmod +x clean_nextcloud_snap
./clean_nextcloud_snap
```


## 3. Link Nextcloud to a bucket in Allas

To be able to link Allas to your Nextcloud server, you must have a valid S3 key pair and a ready made data bucket in Allas. The bucket can be empty or it can already contain some data objects.

You can do this things for example in puhti.csc.fi with commands:

### 1. Setting up the connection:

```text
   module load allas
   allas-conf --mode s3cmd
```

### 2. Creating a new empty bucket

```text
s3cmd mb s3://your-proj-num-nextcloud
```
In this example we are using project 2001234 so
the bucket name could be:

```
2001234-nextcloud
```

### 3. Printing out the keys

```text
grep key $HOME/.s3cfg
```

Now return to the Nextcloud WWW-interface. Once you have defined the Nextcloud admin account, log in as the admin. 
Click the round symbol on the right end of the blue menu bar and select +Apps from the pop-up menu.

From the appearing application list enable _External storage support_. 

Then click the round symbol again and open _settings_ .

In the settings panel on the left side, scroll to the Administration section add select: _External storages_ .

Open the _Add storage_ menu and select : _Amazon S3_

This opens a definition menu here you need to file following parameters

Folder name: display name for the allas bucket (2001234-nextcloud)
Bucket: The bucket you just created  or some older bucket.
Port: 443
Region: US
Enable SSL
Access key: from the output of the grep command above
Secret key: from the output of the grep command above

Then go to the “External storages” in your “Personal” settings click the line containing 
the external folder name just created to ensure that the storage works.

If you now move to the Files tool in the main menu (blue bar on the top), 
you should see an new external storage folder named as defined above.

Now you can click this folder and start uploading and downloading data 
from and to this Allas bucket using the Nextcloud interface.

## 4. Create new Nextcloud user account for an external user

The Nextcloud admin account can create new users and user groups to the Nextcloud server. 
Click the round symbol on the right end of the blue menu bar and select _Users_ from the pop-up menu.

First we create a new user group by clicking _Add group_. Here we name the group as “users” 
and confirm the creation request by typing the password of Nextcloud admin.

Then a new user is created by  clicking _add user_ 
User name and password needs to be defined for the user and the 
new account is added to group _Users_.

Finally, we need to allow this new user to access the  _External storage_ (the bucket from Allas). 
To do that, go back to the Settings view and reopen the _External storages_ settings from the Administration tools. 

Now in the “Available for” column, click the definition field. This lists the users and user groups. 
Choose either the user or user group to allow the new user to access the Allas bucket. You can define both 
read and write permissions or you can also give just read-only access to a user or user group. 
These options are set with the menu that opens from the three dots next to the definition field.

Now you can send the account information to the new user and he/she will be able to use Nextcloud 
to upload and download data to the data bucket that was linked to the Nextcloud server. Note, that this 
user doesn't need to have CSC account, a Nextcloud account is enough.
