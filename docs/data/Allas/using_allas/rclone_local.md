# Local Rclone configuration for Allas

Rclone can be installed in any operating system and thus it provides an effective way 
to use Allas from any computer. You can download a copy of Rclone to your own computer 
form the link below.

   * [Rclone download site](https://rclone.org/downloads/)

Once you have Rclone installed you still need to configure the connection to Allas. Rclone is a 
command line application so both configurarion and actual usage is normally done in a command 
line: _Terminal_ in Mac and Linux, _Command prompt_ or _Powershell_ in Windows.

## Configuring Allas connection in Mac and Linux (Swift and S3)

If you are using Rclone in a local **Linux** or **Mac machine**, you can download 
the `allas_conf` script to set up the connection to your Allas project.

```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/master/allas_conf
source allas_conf -u your-csc-username -p your-csc-project-name
```
Note that you should use the `-u` option to define your CSC username and `-p` to 
define the CSC project you want to use. For example:

```text
source allas_conf -u kkayttaj -p project_2001234
```
The command above defines a connection that uses Swift protocol and is valid in the current
terminal session for 8 hours. The Rclone _remote_ site name is in this case _allas_. After 
configuration you can for example list your buckets in Allas with command:
```text
rclone lsd allas:
```
If you want to use S3 protocol instead of Swift, add option _-m S3_ to the configuration command. 
```text
source allas_conf -u kkayttaj -p project_2001234 -m S3
```
Note that in order to run the command above you must have _OpenStack_ client installed in your local machgine. After configuring S3 connection to Allas, you can use it through Rclone remote called _s3allas:_ . For example:

```text
rclone lsd s3allas:
```
S3 connection is active until you explicitly delete it with command:

```text
source allas_conf -u csc-user-name -p csc-project-name --s3remove
```

!!!Note

  Remember to be careful and security aware, when configuring S3 connection to Allas. The S3 keys are stored in a readble format in you home directory and anyone how can read your keys can access Allas until the keys are expilisitly revoked from Allas. Removing the keys from your own computer is not enough to deactivate them.

## Configuring Allas connection in Windows 

In Windows machines you can't use _allas_conf_ script. So for Windows some connection specific variables need to be checked up in parallel from a Linux/Mac supporting  _allas_conf_ script. Easiest could be Puhti, if you use it otherwise. One option is also to use Windows Linux Subsystem and then the instructions above can be followed.

Configure the Allas connetion with command:

```text
rclone config
```
You can use this command also in other machines where _allas_conf_ is not available.
The command above launches a configration process that you can use to define new Rclone 
connetion. In Rclone these defined connections are called as _remotes_. 

Below we describe how to create Swift and S3 connections to Allas.

#### Configuring Swift connection in Windows

Start the process by executing command:

```text
rclone config
```
And do following selections:

   1. Select **n** to create a _New remote_
   2. Name the remote as: **allas**
   3. From the list of storage protocols, select the number that defines:
_OpenStack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)_
   4. Select authentication option **2** _Get swift credentials from environment vars._
   5. After that select the default _blank_ setting for all the remaining settings until you are back in the starting menu of the confguration process. 
   6. Finally, choose **q** to stop the configuration process.
 
In the case of Swift you need to do this configuration only once. In the configuration 
it is now defined that in case of _allas_, all data for the connection is red from environment variables.

If you have access to [Puhti](https://puhti.csc.fi), then the easiest way to check the values of the variables needed is to open terminal connection to it and activate there connection to the Allas project you wish to use. Another option is to use a utility program [allas-get-swift-token-win.zip](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-get-swift-token/releases/download/v1.0.0/allas-get-swift-token-win.zip). If you choose to use the utility program, you (or your local it-support) may have to configure your anti-virus etc software to allow running it.

This Swift access is done in Puhti with commands:

```text
module load allas
allas-conf
```
After that you can check the variable values with commands:

```text
echo $variable_name
```
The variables required for the Allas Swift access are:

   * **OS_STORAGE_URL**, Check this value in Puhti with commad  _echo $OS_STORAGE_URL_ .
   * **OS_AUTH_TOKEN**, Check this value in Puhti with commad  _echo $OS_AUTH_TOKEN_ .

The value in the variable OS_STORAGE_URL stays the same as long as you are accessing the same project.
OS_AUTH_TOKEN variable contains the actual authentication token. This token is valid only for 8 hours 
so you typically need to generate and check it each time you start using Rclone in your computer.

At the moment we don't have a tool for generating this value in Windows so you need to 
use Puhti (or some other machine that can run allas_conf tool) to generate this project 
specific temporary token.

For example, if in Puhti running the allas-conf would produce following values:

<pre>
<b>module load allas</b>
<b>allas-conf</b>
<b>echo $OS_STORAGE_URL</b>
https://a3s.fi:443/swift/v1/AUTH_5d66718fa0ff46ee1b2581b2225ee1a9d
<b>echo $OS_AUTH_TOKEN</b>
gAAAAABiVAJ08lSVPXH4MqXDb-Vo0KdQgm9reOA7IRf-PavF-RktYpp3K_7kp-5Ck137hsBQl66qRFmd4PE4hEVz0TWwTTmVIPUmmxQ
</pre>

Then in **Windows PowerShell** you could set up Allas connection with commands:

```text
$Env:OS_STORAGE_URL = "https://a3s.fi:443/swift/v1/AUTH_5d66718fa0ff46ee1b2581b2225ee1a9d"
$Env:OS_AUTH_TOKEN = "gAAAAABiVAJ08lSVPXH4MqXDb-Vo0KdQgm9reOA7IRf-PavF-RktYpp3K_7kp-5Ck137hsBQl66qRFmd4PE4hEVz0TWwTTmVIPUmmxQ"
```

In the **Windows Command Prompt** the corresponding set up commands would be:
```text
set OS_STORAGE_URL=https://a3s.fi:443/swift/v1/AUTH_5d66718fa0ff46ee1b2581b2225ee1a9d
set OS_AUTH_TOKEN=gAAAAABiVAJ08lSVPXH4MqXDb-Vo0KdQgm9reOA7IRf-PavF-RktYpp3K_7kp-5Ck137hsBQl66qRFmd4PE4hEVz0TWwTTmVIPUmmxQ
```


With these settings done, you should be able to check your buckets with command:
```text
rclone.exe lsd allas:
```



#### Configuring S3 connection in Windows

Remember that you need to be careful and security aware, when configuring S3 connection to Allas. The S3 keys are stored in a readble format in you home directory and anyone how can read your keys can access Allas until the keys are expilisitly revoked from Allas. Removing the keys from your own computer is not enough to deactivate them.

To check your S3 keys, open connection to Puhti (or some other machine that can run allas_conf tool). If you don't yet have S3 connetion to your Allas project activated, open it with commands:

```
module load allas
allas-conf -m S3
```
This creates a local configuration files that we will later on use to check some values.

Then switch to you Windows _Command Prompt_ and start the rclone configuration process by executing command:

```text
rclone config
```
And do following selections:

   1. Select **n** to create a _New remote_
   2. Name the remote as: **s3allas**
   3. From the list of storage protocols, select the number that defines: _Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including AWS, Alibaba, Ceph, Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, IBM COS, Minio, and Tencent COS_
   4. Next you are asked to Choose your S3 provider. Select option that provides _Any other S3 compatible provider_
   5. The select that you _Enter AWS credentials in the next step_ 
   6. Give the _AWS access key_. You can check this in Puhti with command: 
   _grep access_key $HOME/.s3cfg  | cut -d " " -f3_ 
   7. Give the _AWS secret access key_. You can check this in Puhti with command: 
   _grep secret_key $HOME/.s3cfg  | cut -d " " -f3_ 
   8. Region **1**
   9. Endpoint: **a3s.fi**
   10. Location constant: (blank, just press entwer)
   11. acl: **1**
   12. Edit advanced config: **n**
   13. Remote config: **y** Yes, this is ok.
   14. **q**, quit config
 
After this you can access your Allas project using Rclone remote _s3allas_. For example:

```text
rclone.exe lsd s3allas:
```

This connection stays active in your laptop until you delete it.
