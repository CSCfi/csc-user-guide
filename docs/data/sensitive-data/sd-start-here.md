# Accessing Sensitive Data (SD) services 
  
CSC's Sensitive Data (SD) services are available to researchers and students affiliated with Finnish higher education institutions (universities, universities of applied sciences) or a state research institute and their international collaborators.
## Processing sensitive research data

Access to the services is managed directly by the CSC project manager (e.g. research project's principal investigator, group leader, or postdoc) using the MyCSC portal, and it is based on a CSC project. The CSC project manager can add members with equal access permissions to the same project. They can upload encrypted data to SD Connect and analyze it using the SD Desktop services. However, only the project manager can export non-sensitive results from the secure computing environment. 

To access SD Connect and SD Desktop for storing, sharing or analyzing sensitive research data:

1. Create a [CSC account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) by logging in at the [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi).

2. Create or join a CSC project and add project members.

3. Fill in the _Description of processing activities form_ and accept _CSC's Data Processing Agreement_.  

4. All project members should add service access to Allas (to use SD Connect) and SD Desktop, accepting the terms of use. 

5. All project members should activate their account's additional security verification (or Multi-factor Authentication) by scanning the QR code with a mobile application (e.g. Google Authenticator).

6. Apply for billing units or disk quota.


For video tutorials and further guidance, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) section at the beginning of this manual.

Once you have completed these steps, you can log in with identity federation systems (Haka, Virtu, CSC Login, or LSLogin) at:

* [https://sd-connect.csc.fi](https://sd-connect.csc.fi) 	 
  
* [https://sd-desktop.csc.fi](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi)	 
  

with any modern web-browser (Note: private browsing is not supported using Firefox).
