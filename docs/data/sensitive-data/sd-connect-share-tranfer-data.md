# How to transfer your data to another project with SD Connect


## Use case
You (Team A) have datasets that other team (Team B) needs access to. They wish to view your data and analyse it in their own environment. You are willing to give them a copy of your dataset.

## Solution
In this case you can share your data folder to Team B with **Transfer data** -permission. This allows Team B members to view your data, copy it and download the copy for themselves. Team B can have their own copy for analysis without affecting your original dataset.

## Step by step tutorial

Both teams should have their own CSC project and SD Connect activated. If you don't have one yet, please follow instructions from [Start here](sd-access.md) and return to this tutorial after you have set up the CSC project.

1. Ask from Team B for their project Share ID. They find it from their SD Connect

2. Log in to [SD Connect](./sd-connect-login.md).
3. Upload your data folder to SD Connect: [See upload instructions](./sd-connect-upload.md).
4. Click “**Share**” next to the folder you wish to share.

Now all the content of the folder is visible to Project B. All project members in Project B can copy, download, and decrypt the content of the folder via SD Connect. They can also access it via SD Desktop for analysis. However, they can not modify your original folder.
