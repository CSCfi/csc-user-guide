# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research

## Introduction 

Sensitive Data (SD) services for research provide CSC customers with a secure workspace accessible via a web browser that can be used for processing sensitive data according to CSC's General Terms of Use.

Sensitive Data services for research consist of five components:

[![SD-service-overview](images/introduction/icons.png)](images/introduction/icons.png)

* Sensitive Data Connect: a user interface for importing and storing sensitive data to CSC's cloud storage solution (Allas). SD Connect also facilitates sharing or transferring encrypted sensitive data during the active phases of research projects ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-connect)). 

* Sensitive Data Desktop: a user interface that provides access to a secure virtual computer (or virtual Desktop). It enables secure computation and analysis of sensitive data. 

* Sensitive Data Submit and Federated EGA (*pilot phase*): allows publishing of sensitive and biomedical data under controlled access ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega)). 

* Sensitive Data Apply (*pilot phase*): promotes data reuse allowing data owners to manage access to published datasets via a simple user interface.

These services are suitable for processing **sensitive research data** in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. 

A **restricted version of SD Desktop** is provided **for processing register-based research under the Finnish Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social data**. The regulation applies when health and social information is collected and saved in a register, for example, during examination in health care services or while applying for social benefits, and in a second moment, the original information is used for a different purpose, for example, research. In this case, the processing is possible only in a certified computing environment in compliance with Act on the Secondary Use and the Findata Authority's Regulation. The limitations are described in the SD Desktop ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-desktop)).

In this manual, you can find an overview of each service's key features and limitations, step-by-step instructions and video tutorials (specific sections are marked as *advanced* if technical expertise is required), and quick solutions in the troubleshooting table. 

!!! Note
    Sensitive data is only accessible with appropriate authorization, rights, or permission. With SD services, access is always managed by the data controller via specific service components in compliance with the GDPR and national regulations. For example, you can directly manage research data access, uploads, or data export using SD Connect and SD Desktop. In contrast, access to register data via SD Desktop is operated by CSC's helpdesk, based on the data permit issued by the Findata Authority and in compliance with Finnish regulations. The following section of this user guide provides an overview of permission management via SD services based on the data type and legal bases for data processing and asummary of the main documentation that should be considered.
