# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research

## Introduction 

Sensitive Data (SD) services for research provide CSC customers with a secure workspace accessible via a web browser that can be used for processing sensitive data according to CSC's General Terms of Use.

Sensitive Data services for research consist of five components:

[![SD-service-overview](images/introduction/icons.png)](images/introduction/icons.png)

* Sensitive Data Connect: a user interface for importing and storing sensitive data to CSC's cloud storage solution (Allas). SD Connect also facilitates sharing or transferring encrypted sensitive data during the active phases of research projects ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-connect)). 

* Sensitive Data Desktop: a user interface that provides access to a secure virtual computer (or virtual Desktop). It enables secure computation and analysis of sensitive data. In addition, a restricted version of SD Desktop is provided for processing register data and the limitations are described in a separate user guide (see: SD Desktop for secondary Use) ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-desktop)).

* Sensitive Data Submit and Federated EGA (*pilot phase*): allows publishing of sensitive and biomedical data under controlled access ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega)). 

* Sensitive Data Apply (*pilot phase*): promotes data reuse allowing data owners to manage access to published datasets via a simple user interface.

In this manual you can find:

* an overview of each service's key features and limitations;
* step-by-step instructions and video tutorials (specific sections are marked as *advanced* if technical espertise are required);
* quick technical suggestions in the troubleshooting table. 





## Compliance with data protection regulations and permission management 

Sensitive data is data that needs to be protected against unauthorized access. Data protection may be required due to legal or ethical reasons, personal privacy and proprietary considerations. 

Sensitive data includes:

* Personal sensitive data (e.g. health, genetic and personal information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation, data relating to criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures, data that may identify a person)

* Ecological data (e.g. location of endangered species or other conservation efforts)

* Confidential data (e.g. trade secrets)

* Data that is otherwise deemed sensitive.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Finnish national laws regulate sensitive personal data processing. 

According to the GDPR, a data controller is an individual or organization that determines the purposes and means of processing sensitive personal data, and it is usually an academic organization. On the other hand, a data processor is an individual or organization that processes personal data on the controller's behalf, for example, an IT service provider, in this case, CSC. Data processing terms such as duration, scope, and purpose, and the relationship between the data controller and CSC are defined in a legally biding document called Data Protection Agreement (DPA). 

The Finnish Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social Data applies when health and social information is collected and saved in a register (for example, during examination in health care services, or while applying for social benefits), and then the original information is used for a different purpose, for example research. In this case processing is possible only in a certified computing environment in compliance with the Finnish Act on the Secondary Use and the Findata Authority's Regulationn. 


!!! Note
    Sensitive data is only accessible with appropriate authorization, rights, or permission. With SD services, access is always managed by the data controller via specific service components in compliance with the GDPR and national regulations. In the following paraghraph you can find an overview of permission management via SD services and summary of the main documentation that should be considered.

**Research data, ecological data, and confidential data**

SD Connect and SD Desktop usage is based on CSC projects. Access to the services is managed directly by the CSC project manager (e.g. research project's principal investigator, group leader, or postdoc) using the MyCSC portal. The CSC project manager can add members which will have equal access permissions to the same project. They can all upload encrypted data to SD Connect and analyze it using the SD Desktop services. However, only the project manager can export non-sensitive results from the secure computing environment. During CSC account and project creation, users are guided to view CSC's Data Processing Agreement (DPA). As the CSC project manager is employed by the data cobntroller they also act as it's representative and the DPA becomes valid between the academic organization (the data controller) and CSC (data processor). 

You can then download all the documents  (DPA etc) and share them with the legal services in your organisation or the data controller's representative.

**Health and social data under the Act on Secondary Use**

The Finnish Act on Secondary Use of health and social data regulates register data processing. Therefore, register data can only be provided by the Findata Authority and accessed via the SD Desktop service. CSC's helpdesk manages users' access to  SD Desktop and results export based on the data permit.



**Reaserch data reuse**




## Access  to SD services from non-EU/EEA countries

Access to sensitive data via SD services from a non-EU/EEA country is qualified by the GDPR as a transfer from one data controller to another. In this case, the data controller needs to make an agreement for international data transfers using the EU's standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and make a transfer impact assessment to assess that the state (where the researcher operates) provides an adequate level of data protection and safeguards are in place and that there is has a lawful base for international transfer (such as data subjects have given explicit consents). This is also valid when a collaborator is analysing files using the SD Desktop via data streaming. Please contac your organization legal services for advice and support. You can also write at servicedeskcsc.fi (subjuect: sensitive data). 


## Data Protection Impact assessment

When creating a CSC project using the MyCSC portal, you are guided to the "Description of processing activities" form, where you describe the data type you are processing. This document will guide you in identifying a data controller, 






You can then download these documents and share them with the legal services in your organisation or the data controller's representative. 

In this table, you can find the legal office contact and material from several Finnish academic organizations:
