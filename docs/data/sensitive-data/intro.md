# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research

## Introduction 

Sensitive Data (SD) services for research provide CSC customers with a secure workspace accessible via a web browser that can be used for processing sensitive data according to CSC's General Terms of Use.

Sensitive Data services for research consist of five components:

* Sensitive Data Connect: a user interface for importing and storing sensitive data to CSC's cloud storage solution (Allas). SD Connect also facilitates sharing or transferring encrypted sensitive data during the active phases of research projects ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-connect)). 

* Sensitive Data Desktop: a user interface that provides access to a secure virtual computer (or virtual Desktop). It enables secure computation and analysis of sensitive data. In addition, a restricted version of SD Desktop is provided for processing registry data (secondary Use of health and social data). The limitations are described in a separate user guide (see: SD Desktop for secondary Use) ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-desktop)).

* Sensitive Data Submit and Federated EGA (*pilot phase*): allow publishing of sensitive and biomedical data under controlled access ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega)). 

* Sensitive Data Apply (*pilot phase*): promotes data reuse allowing data owners to manage access to published datasets via a simple user interface.

You can find an overview of each service's key features and limitations in each section of this manual. Technical knowledge or expertise is optional for SD services, and step-by-step instructions and video tutorials are provided. Specific sections are marked as *advanced* if programming skills are required. Quick technical suggestions are available in the troubleshooting table. 


## Compliance with data protection regulations

Sensitive data is data that needs to be protected against unauthorized access. Data protection may be required due to legal or ethical reasons, personal privacy, and proprietary considerations. 

Sensitive data includes:

* Human data (e.g. health, genetic and personal information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation, data relating to criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures, data that may identify a person)

* Ecological data (e.g. location of endangered species or other conservation efforts)

* Confidential data (e.g. trade secrets)

* Data that is otherwise deemed sensitive.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Finnish national laws regulate sensitive personal data processing. 

According to the GDPR, a data controller is an individual or organization that determines the purposes and means of processing sensitive personal data, and it is usually an academic organization. On the other hand, a data processor is an individual or organization that processes personal data on the controller's behalf, for example, an IT service provider, in this case, CSC. Data processing terms such as duration, scope, and purpose, and the relationship between the data controller and CSC are defined in a legally biding document called Data Protection Agreement (DPA). 

The Finnish Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social Data applies when health and social information is collected and saved in a register (for example, during examination in health care services, or while applying for social benefits), and then the original information is used for a different purpose, for example research. In this case a data permit authority, Findata, or the register in question issues data permits and processing is possible only in a certified processing environment in compliance with the Finnish Act on the Secondary Use and the Findata Authority's Regulationn. 


!!! Note
    Sensitive data is only accessible with appropriate authorization, rights, or permission. With SD services, access is always managed by the data controller via specific service components in compliance with the GDPR and national regulations.
    

In the following paragraphs, we summarise 





### Permission management: research data, ecological data, and confidential data

SD Connect and SD Desktop usage is based on CSC projects. Access to the services is managed directly by the CSC project manager (e.g. research project's principal investigator, group leader, or postdoc) using the MyCSC portal. The CSC project manager can add members with equal access rights to the same project. They can all upload encrypted data to SD Connect and analyze it using the SD Desktop services. However, only the project manager can export non-sensitive results from the secure computing environment. During CSC account and project creation, users are guided to view CSC's Data Processing Agreement (DPA). As the CSC project manager is emplyed by the data cobntroller they also act as it's representative and the DPA becomes valid between the academic organization (the data controller) and CSC (data processor). 

You can then download these documents and share them with the legal services in your organisation or the data controller's representative. 
In this table, you can find the legal office contact and material from several Finnish academic organizations:



### Permission management: health and social data under the Act on Secondary Use

The Finnish Act on Secondary Use of health and social data regulates register data processing. Therefore, register data can only be provided by the Findata Authority and accessed via the SD Desktop service. CSC's helpdesk manages users' access to and results export from the SD Desktop service based on the data permit.


### Access from non-EU/EEA countries

Access to sensitive data via SD services from a non-EU/EEA country is qualified by the GDPR as a transfer from one data controller to another. In this case, the data controller needs to make an agreement for international data transfers using the EU's standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and make a transfer impact assessment to assess that the state (where the researcher operates) provides an adequate level of data protection and safeguards are in place and that there is has a lawful base for international transfer (such as data subjects have given explicit consents). This is also valid when a collaborator is analysing files using the SD Desktop via data streaming. Please contac your organization legal services for advice and support. You can also write at servicedeskcsc.fi (subjuect: sensitive data). 


### Data Protection Impact assessment

When creating a CSC project using the MyCSC portal, you are guided to the "Description of processing activities" form, where you describe the data type you are processing. This document will guide you in identifying a data controller, 






You can then download these documents and share them with the legal services in your organisation or the data controller's representative.

In the following paragraphs, we summarise the main aspect and processes that need to be considered when accessing SD service. 


###  Compliance when processing research data, ecological data, and confidential data

SD Connect and SD Desktop usage is based on CSC projects. Access to the services is managed directly by the CSC project manager (e.g. research project's principal investigator, group leader, or postdoc) using the MyCSC portal. The CSC project manager can add members with equal access rights to the same project. They can all upload encrypted data to SD Connect and analyze it using the SD Desktop services. However, only the project manager can export non-sensitive results from the secure computing environment. During CSC account and project creation, users are guided to view and accept CSC's Data Processing Agreement. As the data controller employs the project manager, they act as the data controller's representative and the Data Processing Agreement becomes valid between the academic organization (the data controller) and CSC (data processor). 


### Compliance when processing health and social data under the Act on Secondary Use

The Finnish Act on Secondary Use of health and social data regulates register data processing. Therefore, register data can only be provided by the Findata Authority and accessed via the SD Desktop service. CSC's helpdesk manages users' access to and results export from the SD Desktop service based on the data permit.

## Useful terminology

**Allas**: a cloud storage service of CSC. SD Connect is an interface that facilitates sensitive data encryption and storage in Allas. Users can also access Allas programmatically with interfaces for non-sensitive data.

**Billing units**: billing units are used to monitor the resource (when CSC services are free-of-charge or when the user pays to use the services).

**Bucket/Container**: these two terms refer to the main folder (technically called root folder) where data are stored in SD Connect/Allas. The bucket/container name is visible on the internet. You can have multiple buckets in the same project (up to 1000), but each bucket must have a unique name throughout the whole storage system (including other projects). By default, the data in a bucket is accessible just to the project members. However, you can share and grant access to other CSC projects or users with SD Connect.

**CSC Project**: using CSC services is based on projects: all your data in CSC belong inside a project. You can be a project member in one or multiple projects. Each project has a primary user, the CSC project manager, who can add members and services to the project. A project manager is responsible for the activities of the project. They, for example, need to describe which type of sensitive data the project is processing.

**Disk quota**: this is a limited set to control the storage space available to CSC services users. SD Connect has a default quota of 10 TB. You can apply for more writing at servicedesk@csc.fi. 

**Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**: a data processing agreement (DPA) is a contract between the Data Controller and the Data Processor. It regulates the particularities of data processing – such as its scope and purpose – as well as the relationship between the controller and the processor: [CSC General terms of use](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use) and [CSC Data Processing Agreement](https://research.csc.fi/data-processing-agreement).

**Multi-factor Authentication**: When you log in to the SD Desktop service, you must undergo an extra verification step to authenticate by providing a username and password. In this way, your account is more secure. The extra verification step is called:"Two-Step Verification" or "Multifactor Authentication", because you are proving your identity via a different method. In this case, you need to type in a one-time code (6-digits) obtained by opening a mobile app on your phone. The code is unique and valid for a limited amount of time.

**Object**: technical name for a file stored in a cloud object storage like Allas (or uploaded to CSC via SD Connect). This definition underlines that files stored in SD Connect /  Allas can not be directly modified unless transferred or copied into a computing environment. Still, they can be accessed in read-only mode from a cloud computing environment (e.g. SD Desktop). 

**Project Identifier**: a synonym of CSC Project ID when using the command-line tool. In the SD Connect user interface is displayed under User Information> Project usage and displayed as a series of 32 numbers and letters: e.g. AUTH_3a66dbf90b2940dc9c651362af595b23.

**Virtual machine (VM)**: a virtual computing environment (or virtual computer) that works as an actual physical computer. It has a processor, memory, and operating system, but it exists only as a code or a partition of the host computer in CSC’s data center. The VMs used for the Sensitive Data services are entirely isolated from the internet for security reasons.

**Virtual machine flavor (VM flavor)**: a flavor defines the resources and configurations of a cloud computing environment. It specifies the compute, memory, and storage capacity that can be assigned to the virtual machine.
