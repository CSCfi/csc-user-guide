## Step by step

1. Login page: **[https://sd-connect.csc.fi](https://sd-connect.csc.fi){ target="_blank" }**.
2. **Authentication:** Login to SD Connect is currently possible only with CSC credentials or Haka (identity federation system).
3. **MFA Authentication:** After entering your username and password, you need to verify your identity with a second verification step (i.e. Multi-factor Authentication, MFA). Enter the verification code provided via your MFA mobile application (e.g. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) and press on *Continue*. For specific guidance, see the [MFA section](../../accounts/mfa.md)
