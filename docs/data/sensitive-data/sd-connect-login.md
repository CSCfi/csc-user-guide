3. Verify your identity with the temporary code (Multi-factor authentication); click on *Continue*.
4. You might now encounter an additional page stating that your account needs to go through identity verification. Please press on *Proceed* to continue at the bottom of the message.
5. You will now be redirected one more time to the login page. Here, please select again the login method (Haka or CSC Login) and press on *Login*.
