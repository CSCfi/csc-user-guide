# Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA)

Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA) is a service for storing and publishing human genetic and phenotypic data consented for research use. The service is based on an international network of local repositories. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. Please note that this user guide is specific for Finnish FEGA service.

You can use FEGA to submit biomedical datasets to be published under controlled access. In SD Apply service, you can apply or approve access to datasets published with FEGA. The sensitive research data submitted to the service remains in Finland, while at the same time, the public descriptive information about the data (metadata) is made internationally available in central [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/studies) (EGA). Each dataset must have a Data Access Committee (DAC), which evaluates data access applications and can grant or deny data access for re-use in SD Apply service. If the application is approved, the applicant can directly access and analyse the sensitive data in a secure and private cloud workspace using CSC Sensitive Data Services for research. Publishing data with FEGA requires a separate contract with CSC. Choose the correct user guide below:

## Useful terminology

- **Central EGA**. Central European Genome-phenome Archive. When submitting data to FEGA, the metadata is made internationally available in central EGA. 

- **Data Access Committee (DAC)**. Individual or group of individuals who are controllers for a dataset stored at FEGA and are responsible for approving and rejecting access requests to that dataset.

- **Data Applicant**. Individual who applies access to sensitive data that has been stored at FEGA.

- **Data Submitter**. Individual who uploads data to FEGA for re-use under controlled access and describes it with metadata, which will be publicly available. The data submitter represents data owner organisation during the submission process.

- **Finnish FEGA**. A national repository for biomedical data consented for research. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. The research data uploaded to Finnish FEGA will remain under controlled access in Finland.
