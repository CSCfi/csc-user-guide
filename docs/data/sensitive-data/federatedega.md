# Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA)

Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA) is a service for storing and sharing human -omics data consented for research. The service is based on a European network of local repositories. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. 

You can use FEGA either to submit or apply access to biomedical datasets. The service allows you to store sensitive research data under controlled access in Finland. At the same time, the public information (metadata) is made internationally available in central [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/studies) (EGA). Each dataset is associated with a Data Access Committee (DAC), which evaluates data access applications and can grant or deny data access for re-use. If the application is approved, the requester can directly access and analyse the sensitive data in a secure and private cloud workspace using CSC Sensitive Data Services for research. 

!!! note
    For more information, check Federated EGA [service description](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega) in CSC service catalog and [CSC sensitive Data Services for research webpage](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data-services-for-research).

The following is a step-by-step guide to Finnish FEGA that illustrates:

- **[Data submission](https://github.com/CSCfi/csc-user-guide/edit/wip-at-fega/docs/data/sensitive-data/federatedega.md#data-submission)**
- Data access application
  - For Data Requesters
  - For Data Access Committee

## Useful terminology

- **Central EGA**. Central European Genome-phenome Archive. When submitting data to FEGA, the metadata is made internationally available in central EGA. 
- **Data Access Committee (DAC)**. Individual or group of individuals who are controllers for a dataset stored at FEGA and are responsible for approving and rejecting access requests to that dataset.
- **Data Requester**. Individual who applies access to sensitive data or metadata that has been stored at FEGA.
- **Data Submitter**. Individual who uploads data, metadata, and other information to FEGA for re-use under controlled access. 
- **Finnish FEGA**. A national repository for biomedical data consented for research. CSC hosts Finnish FEGA. The research data uploaded to Finnish FEGA will remain under controlled access in Finland.

## Data submission
### Step 1: Application form
To begin the submission process, please fill in the [application form](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/fega-application.docx) with contact information, details about the type of data submission, and information about the data controller. Send the filled form via email to servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Federated EGA). You will receive further instructions.

!!! note
    Data submission might take up to a month or more. Therefore, please get in touch with us well in advance (before submitting your manuscript to a scientific journal). In this way, we can offer proper support and guide you during the entire process.
    
### Step 2: Legal agreements 
Each user must provide a series of legal agreements to confirm that they have the authority and permission to deposit data in FEGA. You can share the agreements concerning the data controller with the legal service of your home organisation and send the finalised documents via email to servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Federated EGA). We will provide additional support if specific agreements are needed. 

!!! note
    The required legal documents state the roles of a data processor and a data controller, which are defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). CSC acts always as a data processor. In most research projects, the data controller is an academic organisation or other legal entity. 

Here’s a list of the required documents:

- **[Data Processing Agreement](https://research.csc.fi/data-processing-agreement)** (DPA). A data processing agreement (DPA) is a contract between the Data Controller and the Data Processor. It regulates the particularities of data processing – such as its scope and purpose – as well as the rights and duties between the controller and the processor. 
- **[CSC General terms of use](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use)**.
- **[Description of the data processing activities](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/data-processing-form.docx)**.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**. In case you need to draft a DPIA, you can find the technical and organisational security measures for the protection of sensitive data in CSC Sensitive Data Services available for download here <br/><br/>
- **Data Access Agreement (DAA)**. In addition to the legal documents concerning the data controller, you should provide a DAA which is a contract between the Data Access Committee ([DAC](https://ega-archive.org/submission/data_access_committee)) and an requester. The DAA includes all the policies regulating data re-use (e.g., data use, publication, download, or access) and it will be linked to each submitted dataset in the central EGA submitter portal. Your academic organisation might provide a template for the DAA or give you information and assistance. In specific cases, the document needs to be drafted by a legal representative. A copy of the agreement can be returned to servicedesk@csc.fi (subject Federated EGA).
