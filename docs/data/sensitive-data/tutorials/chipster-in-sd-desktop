Running Chipster in SD Desktop

Chipster is a user-friendly analysis software for high-throughput Life science data 
such as Visium, single-cell and bulk RNA-seq. Chipster provides a web interface to 
over 500 analysis tools that can be combided into workflows. 

The publick Chipster server, availabel in https://chipster.csc.fi is not intended 
for prcessing sensitive data. This document describes how you can install your own 
Chipster server to an SD Desktop virtual machine for analyzing sensitive data.

  Before installation

Installing a Chipster server requires significant storage resources and running it 
requires plenty of memory. Because of that you should apply for at least 1 TB volume 
for the virtual machine where you plan to install chipster. Further, as some applications 
in Chipster require significant amount of memory the flavor of the SD Desktop virtual 
machine should medium computation or heavy computation.

Note that all the users of a SD Desktop mechine can use the same Chipster server. In these 
cases it is good practice to assing a one user as a "Chipster managers" that install an 
manage the Chipster server.
