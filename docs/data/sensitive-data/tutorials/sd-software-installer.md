# SD Desktop Software Installer

As SD desktop virtual desktops are isolated from internet, installing additional software and libraries 
to your virtual desktop is not straight forward. Adding extra software is possible, but it requires that 
you convert the installation processes into files that can be uploaded to SD Connect and from there 
copied to your SD Desktop environment for installation and usage.

In general, we recommend using Apptainer containers for importing the software you need.

To make additional software installations easier, CSC has created a **SD Software Installer** tool,
that provides an easy way to add few commonly used software packages and help tools to your virtual desktop. 
This document describes the usage of this tool.


## Requirements

In order to get access to the installation tool, you need to **[send a request to CSC Service Desk](../../../support/contact.md)**.
In the request, indicate that you wish that the SD software installer would be 
made available for your project. You must include the **Project identifier string** of your project to the request.
You can check this 32 characters long random string for example in the [SD Connect service](https://sd-connect.csc.fi). 
There you find the Project Identifier in the **User information** view. 

## Installing the SD Software Installer

Log in to your SD Desktop and open **Data Gateway**. If the software installation help tools are enabled for your project,
then you should have folder `tools-for-sd-desktop` included in the directory that Data Gateway created 
(in `Projects/SD-Connect/your-project-name`).

Open `tools-for-sd-desktop` folder and from there, drag/copy file `sd-installer-centos7.desktop` or `sd-installer-ubuntu22.desktop` to your desktop.
Select the version that matches the operating system of your SD Desktop.

Double-click the copy of the installer tool in your desktop to start the software installation tool. In Ubuntu based virtual desktops you
need to right-click the and select _Allow Launching_ before you can use the installer.

## Usage

In order to use the installer, you must have an active Data Gateway connection running and 
mounting of the SD Connect data should be done through the default location in the file system 
(_Projects_ directory in the users home directory). 

The installer shows a panel of buttons that allow you to install a software by just clicking the button.
The available software include graphical and command line applications. For graphical applications, a launching icon is added 
to the desktop. All software is installed to directory `/shared-directory/sd-tools/` where the installation is available for all the
users of the virtual desktop.

In case of some applications, part of the installation process occurs only when the application is started for the first time.
Thus, you should start the application once after the installation, to make sure that the process is completed. After that
the installed software should work also when Data Gateway connection has not been opened.
