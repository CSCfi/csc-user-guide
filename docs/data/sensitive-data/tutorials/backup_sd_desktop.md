# Backup server for SD Desktop

For security reasons only the Project Manager can export data from SD Desktop. Thus normal SD desktop users can not 
make backup copiens of the data that they have in SD Desktop. This tutorial demonstartes the usage of backup_server.sh 
process and sd-backup commands that provide a way for SD Users to backup their data to SD Connect.

## Installation 

The tools for running backup process are not by default installed in SD Desktop Virtual Machines. Thus the firts step is that the Projet 
manager install the sd-help-tools package using the SD-tools-installer. In order to get access to the installer, you need to **send a request to servicedesk@csc.fi**.
In the request, indicate that you wish that the SD Desktop software installation help tools would be made available for your project. 
You must also include to the message the  **Project identifier string** of your project.

You can check this random string for example in the [SD Connect service](https://sd-conenct.csc.fi). There you find the 
Project Identifier in the **User information** view. 

Log in to your SD Desktop and open **Data Gateway**. If the software installation help tools are enabled for your project, then you should have folder: 
**tools-for-sd-desktop** included in the directory that Data Gateway created ( in Projects/SD Coonnect/_your-project-name_).
Open _tools-for-sd-desktop_ folder and from there, drag/copy file **sd-installer.desktop** to your desktop.

Double click the copy of _sd-installer.desktop_ to start the software installation tool. Use this tool to install _sd-help-tools_ 
to your SD Desktop virtual machine if you have not yet done so. 

## Start backup server

When the sd-help-tools are installed, the Project Manager should start new terminal session and there start a virtual terminal session with command:

```text
screen
```
An then launch the backup process with command:

```text
sd-backup-server.sh
```
After that the project manager can leave the virtual session running in background by pressing:
__Ctrl+a+d__.

This way the _sd-backup-server.sh_ command remains active in the virtual terminal session even when the connection to SD Desktop is closed.

The actual server process is very simple. It checks the content of the backup directory once in a minute and moves the contents of this directory 
to a bucket in SD Connect. The data is encrypted with CSC public key only so that the backups can be used only in SD Desktop environment.
The default backup directory is _/shared-data/sd-backup_ and taget bucket in SD Connect is _projet-number_-bacá¸±up. This values can be changed with options
-B and xxxxx.

## Doing backups

When the backup server is running, all users of the VM can use command _sd-backup_ to make a backup copy of the dataset to SD Connect.
The syntax of the sd-backup command is:

```text
sd-backup file.csv
```
or
```text
sd-backup directory
```

The command copies the given file or directory to the backup directory from where the server process is able to move it to SD Desktop.
The the name of virtual machine and timestamp is added to the file name in order to make the file name uniq. In addition a metadata file is
created. This file contains information about the user who requested the backup, original host and location of the file. If backup is requested for 
a directory, then the content of the directory is stored as one tar-archive file and the metadatafile will contain list of the backuped file.
