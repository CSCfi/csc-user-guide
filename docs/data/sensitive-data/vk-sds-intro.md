# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research

## Introduction 

Sensitive Data (SD) services for research offered by CSC provide a secure workspace accessible through a web browser. These services allow users to process sensitive data in accordance with CSC's General Terms of Use.

SD services for research consist of four components:

[![SD-service-overview](images/introduction/icons.png)](images/introduction/icons.png)

* SD Connect: a user interface that allows users to import and store sensitive data in CSC's cloud storage solution (Allas). SD Connect also facilitates sharing or transferring encrypted sensitive data during the active phases of research projects ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-connect)). 

* SD Desktop: a user interface that provides users access to a secure virtual computer (or virtual Desktop). It allows users to do secure computation and analysis of sensitive data. 

* SD Submit and Federated EGA (*pilot phase*): allows publishing of sensitive and biomedical data under controlled access ([service description research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/fega)). 

* Sensitive Data Apply (*pilot phase*): promotes data reuse by allowing data owners to manage access to published datasets through a user-friendly interface.

These services are designed specifically for processing **sensitive research data**. 

In addition, a **restricted version of SD Desktop is provided for processing register-based research under the Finnish Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social Data**. 

* This regulation applies when health and social information is collected and stored in a register and later the information is used in reseach. Such information can be from, for example, examinations in health care services or applications for social benefits. In such cases, the processing is possible only in a certified computing environment in compliance with Act on the Secondary Use and the Findata Authority's Regulation. The limitations are outlined in the SD Desktop ([service description on research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/-/sd-desktop)).

This manual provides an overview of each service's key features and limitations, step-by-step instructions, video tutorials and a trouble shooting table for quick solutions. Advanced technical sections are marked accordingly.

!!! Note
    Sensitive data is only accessible with appropriate authorization, rights, or permission. Access to SD services is always managed by the data controller via specific service components in compliance with the GDPR and national regulations. For example, with SD Connect and SD Desktop, users can directly manage research data access, uploads, or data export. In single register use cases, access to register data via SD Desktop is operated by CSC's helpdesk, based on the data permit issued by the Findata Authority, and in compliance with Finnish regulations.
