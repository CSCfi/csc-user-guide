# Use case: Use folder as your shared workspace

A collaborative research effort involves multiple projects (Project A and Recipient project B). Project A owns a central data workspace and wants to allow members from the Recipient project B to upload additional files to a specific folder. By sharing the folder with **Read, add and delete** permission, members from both projects can collaboratively add, modify, and access files within the shared folder, facilitating data collection efforts.

1. Log in to SD Connect.
2. Choose CSC project A in the top left corner.
3. In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row on the right, click **Share**.
4. In the new window, add the [Share ID](./sd-connect-share.md) of the recipient project B and select the permission level **Read, add and delete**. Click **Share**.
5. All the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient project B. All project members in project B can now copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. They can also upload or delete files within the shared folder, accessible to both projects. The folder's content remains accessible via SD Desktop.
