Read only-access

Use case example: A research team (Recipient project B) needs access to specific data for reference and analysis, but the data owner (Project A) wants to restrict their ability download a copy of the data directly. Project A shares the data folder with read-only access using SD Connect (Beta), ensuring that Project B members can view and analyse the information via SD Desktop, without downloading a copy of the original data.

To provide read-only access to encrypted sensitive data using the SD service, please follow these steps:

Create a CSC project (referred to as Project A): enable service access for SD Connect (Beta). However, do not add any project members.

Create a second CSC project (referred to as Recipient Project B): enable service access for both SD Connect (Beta) and SD Desktop, and add the project members.

Select CSC project: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose CSC project A in the top left corner.

Share folder: Log in to SD Connect (Beta), locate the designated folder, and click on Share. In the new window, input the Share ID of Recipient Project B and select the permission level: Share via SD Desktop only. Click on Share to proceed.

Now, all the content within the folder is visible within Project B and accessible only through SD Desktop. Project members can access and analyse the shared folder content via the virtual desktop. However, they cannot export or download files, as all data exports are managed directly by the project manager.

Please contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi to discuss this option before proceeding.
