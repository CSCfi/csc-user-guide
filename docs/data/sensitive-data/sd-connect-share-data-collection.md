Data Collection
Use case example: A collaborative research effort involves multiple projects (Project A and Recipient project B). Project A owns a central data workspace and wants to allow members from the Recipient project B to upload additional files to a specific folder. By sharing the folder with Manage permissions, members from both projects can collaboratively add, modify, and access files within the shared folder, facilitating data collection efforts.

To allow another CSC project memebrs to add files to one of your projects folder, for example to collect data, follow these steps:

Select CSC project: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose the relevant CSC project in the top left corner.

Share folder: In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row (right-side), click on Share. In the new window, input the Share ID of the recipient project and select the permission level: manage. Click on Share to proceed.

Now, the folder is visible within to the recipient CSC projects. Project members can copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content. They can also upload or delete files within the shared folder, accessible to both projects. The folder's content remains accessible via SD Desktop.
