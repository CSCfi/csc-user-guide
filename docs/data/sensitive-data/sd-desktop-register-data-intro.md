# SD Desktop for secondary use of health and social data

## Introduction

Sensitive Data (SD) Desktop is a registered environment for secondary use of health and social data (register data). Processing secondary use data in SD Desktop requires a permit from the Findata authority. SD Desktop is a web-user interface that allows you to manage a virtual computer from your web browser. With the virtual Desktop, you can access the authorised datasets. No previous knowledge of cloud computing or programming is required to use the service.

### Key features
 * Audited against Findata regulation.
 * Accessible from any operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows) via web-browser from the public internet (without the need of installing a client or using a VPN).
 * To comply with the regulation, SD Desktop for secondary use is completely isolated from the internet and other services: you can only access the data you have requested from Findata.
 * Only the members of the same CSC project can access the same virtual Desktop.
 * After logging in to SD Desktop, you can start a pre-built computing environment (Linux operating system); available options range from the capability of doing simple statistical analysis to machine learning.
 * SD Desktop can be used to work with any type of data: text files, images, audio files, video, and genetic data. However, the virtual Desktop includes a limited set of pre-installed software (open source). Only the permit authority can approve the use of additional software/files/scripts and import them on to your virtual Desktop.

### Before you start
 * You need to have **a data permit** issued by Findata before starting the service access process at CSC.
 * Currently, it is possible to launch up to three virtual Desktops (or computing environments) for each CSC project. Each CSC project has its private Desktop, and each Desktop is isolated from other CSC projects or CSC accounts.
 * SD Desktop for secondary use has a few important limitations: the CSC project will be managed by CSC’s service desk and the data import and export will be restricted (including user’s own script and programs).
 * After your data permit expires, you will no longer have access to your virtual Desktop. To continue working with the same project, you need to send an amendment application to Findata. Otherwise, make sure to request the export of all your results before the validity period of your data permit ends. The expired project and all the data will be deleted after 90 days according to CSC's data retention policy.

    We recommend you to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi well in advance, even before applying for a data permit from Findata, if you need software that is not available on the Desktop as a default.
