## Command Line Interface: data encryption and upload 


!!! note
        Files encrypted with the _Sensitive Data services public key_, can be accessed for data analysis in SD Desktop. If you wish to encrypt the data to transfer them to other services or share them with your collaborators, you can add multiple encryption keys, such as your public key or your collaborator's public key to the encryption.


For general information about using Crypt4GH at CSC check: 
   * [crypt4gh GIT site](https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git)
 
  

1- Install the latest version of Crypt4GH encryption tool

**Python 3.6+ required** to use the crypt4gh encryption utility. 
To install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/

If you have a working python installation and you have permissions to add libraries to your python installation, you can install Crypt4GH with the command:

```text
pip install crypt4gh
```

2- Download CSC Sensitive Data services Public key

Download CSC Sensitive Data Services public key from the link [here](./csc-sd-services.pub), or copy/paste the three lines from the box below into a new file.
The file should be saved in text-only format. Here we assume that the key file is named as _csc-sd-services.pub_.

```text
-----BEGIN CRYPT4GH PUBLIC KEY-----
dmku3fKA/wrOpWntUTkkoQvknjZDisdmSwU4oFk/on0=
-----END CRYPT4GH PUBLIC KEY-----
```

3- Encrypt a file

Crypt4GH can use several public keys for encryption. This can be very handy in cases where the encrypted data needs to be used by several users or services. In this case, the syntax of the encryption command two encrypt the fikes with the Sensitive Data services public key, and your public key is:

```text
crypt4gh encrypt --recipient_pk public-key --recipient_pk public-key < input > output
```
For example

```text
crypt4gh encrypt --recipient_pk services.pub --recipient_pk username.pub < my_data1.csv > my_data1.csv.c4gh
```
The encrypted file (_my_data1.csv.c4gh_) can now be uploaded to SD Connect and will be automatically decrypted when imported into your private computing environment in SD Desktop. Moreover, you will also be able to download and decrypt the data. 
 

### Data encryption and upload with Allas help tool: a-put

The [allas client utilities](https://github.com/CSCfi/allas-cli-utils/) is a set of command-line tools that can be installed and used in Linux and MacOSX machines. If you have these tools, you can use data upload command _a-put_ with command-line option _--sdx_ to upload data to Allas/SD Connect so that the uploaded files are automatically encrypted with the CSC Sensitive Data Services public key before the upload. The public key is included in the tool so that you don't need to download your copy of the key.

You can upload a single file with a command like:

```text
a-put --sdx my_data1.csv
```
By default _a-put --sdx_ uploads the encrypted file into the bucket named _project-number-SD_CONNECT_ . 

You can also upload complete directories and define a specific target bucket. For example, the command below will encrypt and upload all the files in directory _my_data_ to SD Connect into bucket _1234_SD_my_data_.

```text
a-put --sdx my_data -b 1234_SD_my_data
```
You can use a-put to encrypt the data with several keys so that the uploaded data can be used in SD Desktop and other environments.

```text
a-put --sdx my_data -b 1234_SD_my_data --encrypt c4gh --public-key my-key.pub --public-key collaborator-key.pub
```


### Programmatic data upload and download with SD Connect

To upload encrypted data to SD Connect programmatically, you need to use your CSC credentials (CSC username and password).

SD Connect is a user interface for CSC Allas object storage. As SD Connect is based on Swift protocol, it is recommended that you use upload tools that are based on swift protocol. However, you can also use any of the Allas compatible clients to upload your data to SD-Connect programmatically.


These include:

   * [rclone](../Allas/using_allas/rclone.md) (with normal Allas configuration)
   * [swift command line client](../Allas/using_allas/swift_client.md)
   * [Horizon web interface](../Allas/using_allas/web_client.md) in [https://pouta.csc.fi](https://pouta.csc.fi)
   * [CyberDuck](../Allas/using_allas/cyberduck.md) Graphical data transport tool for Windows and Mac.

Note that if you use these tools, you must encrypt your sensitive data before uploading it to SD Connect.




## Command Line Interface: encryption for data sharing 

For documentation and more information, you can check the [Crypt4GH Encryption Utility](https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git) page.

In this example, we first generate your key pair (a password-protected private key and a public key that can be shared with collaborators). Next, we encrypt a file with your private key and the public keys of two different collaborators (research group A and research group B).

**Python 3.6+ is required** to use the Crypt4GH encryption utility. If you need help installing Python, please follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

1- Install the Crypt4GH encryption CLI tool

You can install Crypt4GH directly with pip tool:

```bash
pip install crypt4gh     
```

or, if you prefer the latest sources from GitHub:

```bash
pip install -r crypt4gh/requirements.txt
pip install ./crypt4gh
```

or even:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git
```

The usual `-h` flag shows you the different options that the tool accepts:

```bash
$ crypt4gh -h

Utility for the cryptographic GA4GH standard, reading from stdin and outputting to stdout.

Usage:
   {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] encrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--range <start-end>]
   {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] decrypt [--sk <path>] [--sender_pk <path>] [--range <start-end>]
   {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] rearrange [--sk <path>] --range <start-end>
   {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] reencrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--trim]

Options:
   -h, --help             Prints this help and exit
   -v, --version          Prints the version and exits
   --log <file>           Path to the logger file (in YML format)
   --sk <keyfile>         Curve25519-based Private key.
                          When encrypting, if neither the private key nor C4GH_SECRET_KEY are specified, we generate a new key
   --recipient_pk <path>  Recipient's Curve25519-based Public key
   --sender_pk <path>     Peer's Curve25519-based Public key to verify provenance (akin to signature)
   --range <start-end>    Byte-range either as  <start-end> or just <start> (Start included, End excluded)
   -t, --trim             Keep only header packets that you can decrypt

Environment variables:
   C4GH_LOG         If defined, it will be used as the default logger
   C4GH_SECRET_KEY  If defined, it will be used as the default secret key (ie --sk ${C4GH_SECRET_KEY})
```

You may notice that crypt4gh uses `--sk` option for the private key. This might seem odd but apparently, crypt4gh uses term _secure key_ for private key, hence `sk`, and consequently `pk` refers to public key instead of the private key.

2- Generate your public-private keypair

You use `crypt4gh-keygen` command to create your private and public keys:

```bash
$ crypt4gh-keygen --sk mykey.sec --pk mykey.pub
Generating public/private Crypt4GH key pair.
Enter passphrase for meykey.sec (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter passphrase for mykey.sec (again): 
Your private key has been saved in mykey.sec
Your public key has been saved in mykey.pub
```

where `--sk mykey.sec` is your private (secret, sk) key and `--pk mykey.pub` is your public key (pk). The tool will ask you to enter a password (passphrase) for your private key. For security reasons, the password is not shown when you type it so the tool will ask you to enter it a second time to make sure you made no typing errors (or, you make the same errors twiceâ€¦). Please, use a strong password!

!!! Note
    If you lose or forget your private key, or the password to it, you will be unable to decrypt the files. Do not share your private key or your password.

!!! Note
    You need to create your keys only once and use them for all your encryption needs, but you can of course, choose to generate separate keys for encryption as you wish.

3- Encrypt a file

To ecrypt files you will need 1) your private and public keys, and 2) your recipients' public keys. As stated before, in this example we are sharing the data with two recipients (research groups A and B) and hence, we have received their public keys somehow (e.g. via email). To encrypt a file you use `crypt4gh encrypt` command:

```bash
$ crypt4gh encrypt --sk mykey.sec --recipient_pk groupA.pub --recipient_pk groupB.pub <dog.jpg >dog.jpg.c4gh
Passphrase for mykey.sec: 
```

where `--sk mykey.sec` is your private key, `--recipient_pk groupA.pub` is the research group A's public key, and `--recipient_pk groupB.pub` is the research group B's public key. The `crypt4gh` command uses only standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) so you must use shell redirections: `<` denotes an input file and `>` and denotes an output file, hence `<dog.jpg` reads in a file called _dog.jpg_ and `>dog.jpg.c4gh` writes out an encrypted file named _dog.jpg.c4gh`.

The command will ask you to enter the password (passphrase) of your private key. For security reasons, the password is not displayed when you type it.

!!! Note
    If you want to be able to decrypt the file yourself you must add your own public key also as a recipient.

4- Decrypt a file

To decypt a file you will need a private key which corresponds to one of the public keys used in encryption phase. Let's assume in our example that the research group A is decrypting a file you've sent them. To decrypt a file you use `crypt4gh decrypt` command:

```bash
crypt4gh decrypt --sk groupA.sec <dog.jpg.c4gh >dog.jpg
Passphrase for groupA.sec: 
```

where `--sk groupA.sec` is a corresponding private key to one of the public keys used in the encryption. The `crypt4gh` command uses only standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) so you must use shell redirections: `<` denotes an input file and `>` and denotes an output file, hence `<dog.jpg.c4gh` reads in an ecrypted file called _dog.jpg.c4gh_ and `>dog.jpg` writes out a decrypted file named _dog.jpg_.

The command will ask you to enter the password (passphrase) of your private key. For security reasons the password is not displayed when you type it.

!!! Note
    In case you are decrypting the file in SD Desktop and the CSC Sensitive Data public key has been used in encryption, decryption will be done automatically and you do not need to specify any decryption keys.
