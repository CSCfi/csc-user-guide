# Extending SD Desktop software environment with Singularity containers

In this tutorial we us cPouta to create a singularity conntainer that is used import missing software to SD Desktop.

## 1. Createning your own singularity workbenc to cPouta.

In order to utilize all features of singularity you must run it in an environment where you have adminstration level access rights.
At CSC, you can have adminstrarot level access in virtual machines running in cPouta. Using cPouta for the building process adds a bit 
of extra steps into the process: you have to know how to launch and access virtual machines in cPouta. On the other hand cPouta has a fast 
connection to the Allas service that is used to import the ready made containers to SD Desktop.

As a first step launch virtual machine in cPouta as described in'cPouta user guide
