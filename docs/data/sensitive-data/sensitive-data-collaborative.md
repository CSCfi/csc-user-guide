# How can I share sensitive data with my collaborators?

You can share sensitive data with your collaborators in two different ways:
1) **Data transfer using SD Connect**:
You can transfer encrypted sensitive data using SD Connect. This operation requires a few planning steps and you can learn more in our guide. 
2) **Data streaaeming via SD Desktop**:
Another way to share sensitive data with collaborators is to give them access to your SD Desktop. 
They will then be able to analyze the sensitive data you previously downloaded to SD Desktop, but they will not be able to export it outside the Desktop , dowload it or make copies of it.
