## Attaching a volume to a virtual desktop

When you want to save data to the volume or access the data saved in the volume, you can attach it to a virtual desktop. You can compare this operation to connecting a USB stick to your laptop.

* [Log in](./sd-desktop-login.md) to SD Desktop. On the SD Desktop homepage, click **Manage volumes** on the right side of the correct desktop.

### In Manage volumes window

1. You will see a list of volumes that are available to be attached and/or are attached to the desktop. Click **Attach** on the right side of the volume you want to attach to the desktop.
