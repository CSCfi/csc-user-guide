## Attach a volume to a virtual desktop

When you want to save data to the volume or access the data saved in the volume, you can attach it to a virtual desktop. You can compare this operation to connecting a USB stick to your laptop.

* [Log in](./sd-desktop-login.md) to SD Desktop. On the SD Desktop homepage, click **Manage volumes** on the right side of the correct desktop.

### In the new window

1. You will see a list of volumes that are available to be attached and/or are attached to the desktop. Click **Attach** on the right side of the volume you want to attach to the desktop. 
2. You need to restart your desktop to access the volume. You can restart your desktop via notification or do it later in **Manage desktop** menu if the desktop is in use.
3. Close the window when you are ready.

## Detach a volume from a virtual desktop

You can easily detach a volume from your virtual desktop. You can compare this operation to disconnecting a USB stick from your laptop. The volume and its content will be stored in the same CSC project where it was initially created.

1. [Log in](./sd-desktop-login.md) to SD Desktop. On the SD Desktop homepage, click **Access desktop** on the right side of the correct desktop.

2. Save and close all the files on the volume to prevent data corruption and log out from the virtual desktop.

3. On the SD Desktop homepage, click **Manage volumes** on the right side of the correct desktop.
