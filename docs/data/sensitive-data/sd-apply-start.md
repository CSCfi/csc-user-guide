## Search

To access a specific dataset hosted in Finnish FEGA, navigate to the [EGA webpage](https://ega-archive.org/studies) and search for a particular study, dataset, or DAC using the search field at the top of the page. Then, in the Study view, click on the Dataset ID (EGADNNNN). In the Dataset view, under “Who controls access to this dataset”, click on the link that allows you to access the application form using SD Apply. SD Apply is a service for applying access rights to sensitive datasets stored at CSC. For more information about SD Apply and the application process, please check [SD Apply user guide](./sd-apply.md).

!!! note
    In the EGA webpage, you can also find datasets that are hosted outside Finland, in central EGA or other FEGA nodes. However, this workflow is specific for datasets that are hosted in Finnish FEGA.
