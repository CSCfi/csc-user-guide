# How to dowload and access file encrypted with older version

## Via SD Connect user interface

If you uploaded files encrypted with your encryption key using SD Connect version 1, you can still download them through the SD Connect 2.0 interface. However, these files will remain encrypted, and you will need to decrypt them on your laptop with the Crypt4GH application by following the provided instructions. Please note that you can only decrypt one file at a time. If you need to decrypt multiple files at once, a command line option is available. For further assistance, contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi.

### Preparation:

- **Have your private encryption key available** If you donâ€™t remember the key used, please contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi.
- **Download the Crypt4GH graphical user interface on your laptop** This tool is necessary for decrypting the files. If you experience any issues installing the tool, especially on a laptop provided by your IT department, please contact us for assistance.
  * Install the Crypt4GH application:

  CSC has developed a simple application that will allow you to generate your encryption keys and decrypt data when necessary. Download the version specific to your operating system from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui): (links need to be updated)
  * [Mac](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-macos-amd64.zip)
  * [Windows](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-windows-amd64.zip)
  * [Linux](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-linux-amd64.zip)

  Please check that the tool for Windows has been digitally signed by CSC - IT Center for Science. After the download, you can find the Crypt4GH application in your downloads folder.
  * When you open the application for the first time, you might encounter an error message. In this case, click on _More info_ and verify that the publisher is CSC-IT Center for Science (or in Finnish CSC-Tieteen tietotekniikan keskus Oy) and then click on _Run anyway_.

### Procedure:

1. Access SD Connect v2 and locate the files you need. You can download either the entire bucket or individual files. At the end of the download, the user interface will display the message: "Some requested files could not be decrypted."

![Some requested files could not be decrypted.](https://a3s.fi/docs-files/sensitive-data/SD_Connect/Old_download_1.png)

2. After downloading the files, you need to adjust their extensions. Right-click the file, choose "Rename," and add `.c4gh` to the end of the filename. If opened with a text editor, the files will still be encrypted.

3. Next, you can decrypt the file using the Crypt4GH application and your secret encryption key. Unfortunately, it is currently only possible to single files.
   1. Open the Crypt4GH application and click on _load Your Private Key_.
   2. Click on _Select File_ and upload the file you want to decrypt.
   3. Click on _Open_.
   4. Next, click on _Decrypt File_.
   5. The tool will ask you to write the secret key's password. Press _ok_.

   The secret key must match the public key used to encrypt the data. 

4. Note: In the case of decryption, adding the public key is not mandatory, but if you have the public key of the person who has encrypted the file, you can use it to verify the encryption signature. If you don't select a public key, the activity log will display the following (the decryption will be executed anyway):

   `Sender public key has not been set, authenticity will not be verified.`

   If your decryption runs successfully, the activity log will display the following:

   `Decrypting..... Decryption has finished Decrypted file: C:/users/username/exampledirectory/examplefile`

The decrypted file will no longer display the `.c4gh` extension and will be saved in the same folder from which the original file was uploaded.


* Follow [video](https://youtu.be/SQJ8QEKV7BE?feature=shared) and after downloading the file, change the extension.

### Programmatically

Download and decryption of files uploaded with CLI and own encryption key pair:

To encrypt and upload files via command line, please check [this tutorial](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/sequencing_center_tutorial/) illustrating how to use the crpt4GH tool to upload files in Allas (visible from SD Connect).

Below more information about the crypt4GH <abbr title="Command-Line Interface">CLI</abbr>:

For documentation and more information, you can check the [Crypt4GH Encryption Utility](https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git) page.

In this example, we first generate your key pair (a password-protected private key and a public key that can be shared with collaborators). Next, we encrypt a file with public keys of two different collaborators (research group A and research group B).

**Python 3.6+ is required** to use the Crypt4GH encryption utility. If you need help installing Python, please follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

1. Install the Crypt4GH encryption <abbr title="Command-Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tool

   You can install Crypt4GH directly with pip tool:

`pip install crypt4gh`

or, if you prefer the latest sources from GitHub:

`pip install -r crypt4gh/requirements.txt pip install ./crypt4gh`

or even:

`pip install git+https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh.git`

The usual `-h` flag shows you the different options that the tool accepts:

`$ crypt4gh -h Utility for the cryptographic GA4GH standard, reading from stdin and outputting to stdout. Usage: {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] encrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--range <start-end>] {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] decrypt [--sk <path>] [--sender_pk <path>] [--range <start-end>] {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] rearrange [--sk <path>] --range <start-end> {PROG} [-hv] [--log <file>] reencrypt [--sk <path>] --recipient_pk <path> [--recipient_pk <path>]... [--trim] Options: -h, --help Prints this help and exit -v, --version Prints the version and exits --log <file> Path to the logger file (in YML format) --sk <keyfile> Curve25519-based Private key. When encrypting, if neither the private key nor C4GH_SECRET_KEY are specified, we generate a new key --recipient_pk <path> Recipient's Curve25519-based Public key --sender_pk <path> Peer's Curve25519-based Public key to verify provenance (akin to signature) --range <start-end> Byte-range either as <start-end> or just <start> (Start included, End excluded) -t, --trim Keep only header packets that you can decrypt Environment variables: C4GH_LOG If defined, it will be used as the default logger C4GH_SECRET_KEY If defined, it will be used as the default secret key (ie --sk ${C4GH_SECRET_KEY})`

You may notice that crypt4gh uses `--sk` option for the private key. This might seem odd but apparently, crypt4gh uses term _secure key_ for private key, hence `sk`, and consequently `pk` refers to public key instead of the private key.

### Decrypt a file

To decrypt a file you will need a private key which corresponds to one of the public keys used in encryption phase. Let's assume in our example that the research group A is decrypting a file you've sent them. To decrypt a file they use `crypt4gh decrypt` command:

`crypt4gh decrypt --sk groupA.sec <dog.jpg.c4gh >dog.jpg Passphrase for groupA.sec:`

where `--sk groupA.sec` is a corresponding private key to one of the public keys used in the encryption. The `crypt4gh` command uses only standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) so you must use shell redirections: `<` denotes an input file and `>` and denotes an output file, hence `<dog.jpg.c4gh` reads in an encrypted file called `dog.jpg.c4gh` and `>dog.jpg` writes out a decrypted file named `dog.jpg`.

The command will ask the user to enter the password (passphrase) of your private key. For security reasons the password is not displayed when you type it.

!!! Note
    In case you are decrypting the file in SD Desktop and the CSC Sensitive Data public key has been used in encryption, decryption will be done automatically, and you do not need to specify any decryption keys. If you need to decrypt a large number of files, please check the tutorial [Decrypting all files in a directory](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/tutorials/decrypt-directory/).
