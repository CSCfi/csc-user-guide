# Sensitive Data (SD) Desktop

Once you have access to the service, you can launch your virtual Desktop, choosing between **three pre-built options** (Small, Medium or Heavy computing). This operation can be carried out with a few simple steps and does not require any technical expertise. 

Next, the services will start your virtual Desktop (or, in technical terms: launch a virtual machine) and create a secure connection between CSC and your browser. After launch, your virtual Desktop will be directly available for use every time you log in to the service. Moreover, the running Desktop will consume *billing units* (resources) from your CSC project until it is deleted.

Each CSC project supports the launch of *up to three* virtual Desktops. In addition, each Desktop supports the simultaneous connection of 10 project members. Thus, if you have collaborators as project members in the same CSC project, they will also be able to connect to the virtual Desktop and access the data authorised for your project. Furthermore, all the Desktops are provided with the same software (pre-installed and managed by CSC).
