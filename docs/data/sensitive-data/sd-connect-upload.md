# Uploading and encrypting data via user interface 

Your data is automatically encrypted when you upload data to SD Connect. This is suitable for all file types and formats. More information about encryption (link)
Upload and encrypting less than 100 GB

### Upload and encrypt files to a new folder

1. Log in to SD Connect.
2. Select the correct CSC project in the top left corner.
3. Click **Upload** in the top right corner.
4. In the new window, name the destination folder for your files. 


!!! info "Folder names"

         - Folder names must be unique across all existing folders in all projects in SD Connect and Allas (the cloud storage solution based on which SD Connect is developed). If you can't create a new folder, another project may already use the name you have chosen. To avoid this situation, it is good practice to include project-specific identifiers (e.g., project ID number or acronym) in the folder name.
         - Avoid spaces and special characters; use Latin alphabets (a-z), numbers (0-9), dash (-), underscore (_), and dot (.). Remember, all folder names are public; please do not include any confidential information.
         - Folder names can't be modified afterwards.

Note

Members in the same CSC project can download and decrypt data from SD Connect. This can be limited by sharing files in read-only mode. More information about read-only mode (link)

!!! info "Additional consideration"

      - Uploading large or numerous files may take several hours depending on the internet speed. Note that upload will be automatically stopped after 8 hours.
      - SD Connect user interface visualises the destination folders where your encrypted data is stored. Think of the destination folder like a virtual box on the internet where you keep your digital filesâ€”like photos or documents.
      - You can't edit files directly in SD Connect. Editing is possible after downloading files on your laptop or by accessing the files via SD Desktop.
      - Planning how to organise your files in SD Connect  folders is a crucial step for efficient data management. Carefully consider storing the files based on projects, themes, or logical structures to enhance accessibility and streamline workflow. A well-thought-out folder structure also facilitates collaboration when sharing access with others.
