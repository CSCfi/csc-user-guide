# Add an external volume (virtual external hard drive)

Add an external  volume to your virtual desktop, extending default storage (80 GB) up to 200 GB.

1. Choose a size that covers the combined size of your dataset and working files. If you are unsure about which volume size you should choose, send an email to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).

2. Name your volume. Note, that the volume name should not include special characters or spaces.

* Itâ€™s recommended to save critical analyses or files on the volume, which can also act as a backup if the virtual desktop becomes unresponsive. Please note that after the virtual desktop is set up, the volume can only be extended with additional storage if no data or files have been saved on it. To request an extension, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), *(subject: SD Desktop)*.

* **You can detach and attach a volume from your virtual desktop** on the SD Desktop Management page. This can be compared to connecting/disconnecting a hard drive to your laptop. This feature is available only on desktops created after February 2023. For additional details, refer to: [Managing volume and desktops](./sd-desktop-manage.md).
