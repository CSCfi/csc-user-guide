## Step by step tutorial

### 1. Create a CSC account

- **Go to [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi){ target="_blank" }**
- Log in with Virtu or Haka, based on your home organization's federation. Select your home organization and log in to their identity service. [How to get an account without Haka or Virtu](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md#getting-an-account-without-haka-or-virtu).
- Fill in your information on the Sign up page.
- Create a password with at least 12 characters, including upper and lowercase letters and at least one number. No special characters allowed.
- You will get your CSC user account confirmation via email.

### 2. Join to CSC project

The project manager has either added you to a CSC project or sent you an invitation link.

* **Option A:** Project manager has already added you as a member. Check your email for a notification and log in to MyCSC to find the project.
* **Option B:** You received an invitation link via email. Click the link to apply for membership, and the project manager will approve your membership application.

### 3. Activate MFA Authentication

You need to activate MFA (multi-factor authentication) to log in the Sensitive Data services. [More about multi-factor authentication](../../accounts/mfa.md).

- Install an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) on your mobile before activating MFA.
- Click **Enable MFA** in the **Project notifications** window (top right corner) or go to the Profile page (left navigation or top right hamburger menu).
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication by clicking **Activate**.
- A QR code will be created. Scan it with your authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- Your app will generate a verification code. Enter this code in the **Verification code** field on MyCSC and click **Verify**.
