# Start here: Accessing secondary use health or social data via Sensitive Data services 

## CSC project enables service usage

Using CSC services is based on CSC projects managed in MyCSC customer portal. Every CSC project has a primary user i.e. **project manager** who creates the project and manages its resources and lifetime. A project manager is usually the leader of the research team. He also acts as a contact person between CSC and the research team. When a project processes dataset for which a permit has been granted by Findata or a single register, CSC adds project members and activates the SD Desktop service.


### 1. Test regular SD Desktop 

You can create a test project and test regular SD Desktop independently to make sure that SD Desktop is suitable for your needs. [Instructions how to access regular SD Desktop](sd-use-case-new-user-project-manager.md). 

If you need software that is not available on the SD Desktop by default, please contact [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (*Subject: Sensitive Data, Secondary use*) well in advance - even before applying for a data permit.

!!! Note
    * [SD Connect](sd_connect.md), a service used for storing sensitive research data, is **not accessible for registry data processing**. It is not possible to directly import any additional data, script, or software into the virtual desktop. 



### 2. Apply for permit 

#### Applying for Findata permit

Accessing secondary use health or social data from public registries requires a permit from the **Findata** authority. Instructions for applying for the data permit can be found on [Findata's website](https://findata.fi/en/permits/){ target="_blank" }.

After acquiring the permit, you can start the service access process with CSC. Next, we will walk you through the steps that need to be completed in order to access the dataset on SD Desktop:

#### Applying single register permit

Accessing secondary use health or social data from single registries requires a permit from the register in question. You can get more information from registers.

After acquiring the permit, you can start the service access process with CSC. This process differs slightly from access process with Findata permit. Next, we will walk you through the steps that need to be completed in order to access the dataset on SD Desktop:
