# Start here: Accessing secondary use health or social data via Sensitive Data services 

## CSC project enables service usage

Using CSC services is based on CSC projects managed in MyCSC customer portal. Each CSC project has a primary user i.e. **project manager** who can add members and manages access to the services. A project manager is responsible for the project's activities and acts as the data controller (or academic organization) representative. They, for example, need to describe which type of sensitive data the project is processing.


### 1. Test regular SD Desktop 

You can create a test project and test regular SD Desktop independently, to make sure that SD Desktop is suitable for your needs. [Instructions how to access regular SD Desktop](sd-use-case-new-user-project-manager.md). 

If you need software that is not available on the SD Desktop by default, please contact [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (*Subject: Sensitive Data, Secondary use*) well in advance - even before applying for a data permit.

!!! Note
    * [SD Connect](sd_connect.md), a service used for storing sensitive research data, is **not accessible for registry data processing**. It is not possible to directly import any additional data, script, or software into the virtual desktop. 



### 2. Apply for permit 

### Applying for Findata permit

Accessing secondary use health or social data from public registries requires a permit from the **Findata** authority. You can apply for the data permit by logging in to Findataâ€™s e-service. Instructions for applying for the data permit can be found on [Findata's website](https://findata.fi/en/permits/){ target="_blank" }.

After acquiring the permit, you can start the service access process with CSC. Next, we will walk you through the steps that need to be completed in order to access the dataset on SD Desktop:

### Applying single register permit

These instructions are for researchers who have received a permit for the secondary use of social and health data **directly from a single public register**. In other words, the permit is not from Findata, and **the permit is issued for SD Desktop**.

Processing data issued directly from a single register differs from processing data issued by Findata. If you have received a permit directly from a single register, you need to use **SD Apply** to access the data on SD Desktop.
