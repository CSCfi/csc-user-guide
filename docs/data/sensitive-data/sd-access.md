# Accessing Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research
  
CSC's Sensitive Data Services are available to researchers and students affiliated with Finnish higher education institutions (universities, universities of applied sciences) or a state research institute. 

!!! Note
    The legal basis for data processing determines which service component and workflow you should use to access the services. For example, you directly manage research data access and uploads. In contrast, access to register data is regulated by CSC's helpdesk, based on the data permit provided by the Fidata authority. 

Below is more information on the steps required to access the services for processing research data, processing register data under the Act for secondary use of health and social data, storage space (or quota) availability, and resource (or billing units) consumption.

You can browse through this chapter using the navigation bar on the right side of this page or the search function.
 
  
  

## Processing sensitive research data
 	 
  
To access SD Connect and SD Desktop for storing, sharing or analysing sensitive research data:

1. Create a user account using the [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) portal.  

2. Create or join a CSC project and add project members.

3. Fill in the _Description of processing activities form_ and accept _CSC's Data Processing Agreement_.


4. All project members should add service access to Allas (to use SD Connect) and SD Desktop, accepting the terms of use. 


5. All project members should activate their account's additional security verification (or Multi-factor Authentication) by scanning the QR code with an application (e.g. Google Authenticator).


6. Apply for billing units or disk quota.


For video tutorials and further guidance, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.

Once you have completed these steps, you can log in with identity federation systems (Haka, Virtu, CSC Login, or LSLogin) at:

* [https://sd-connect.csc.fi](https://sd-connect.csc.fi) 	 
  
 * [https://sd-desktop.csc.fi](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi)	 
  

with any modern web-browser (Note: private browsing is not supported when using Firefox).


## Processing register data under the Act of Secondary Use

Analysing register data differs from the process mentioned above. In this case, CSC's helpdesk managers user's access to the SD Desktop computing environment in compliance with the Finnish Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social data and the Findata authority's regulation.

Register data can only be provided by the Fidata authority and accessed via the SD Desktop service. For more information about data provided by single registers, contact us at: servicedesk@csc.fi.


!!! Note
    Register data processing is subject to several limitations. In this case, the SD Desktop computing environment might not suit your needs, or the software needed for data analysis might not be available as a default program. Therefore, we recommend contacting us at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: sensitive data) before applying for a data permit to verify if the service matches your needs. 

To access and analyse register data via the SD Desktop service:

 1. Create [a CSC account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) by logging in at the [My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi) with your Haka account. If you don't have access to Haka credential provided by your organization, contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi. Additional steps will be necessary to verify your identity.

2. Next, request a CSC project from servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: sensitive data) providing: - a copy of the data permit issued by the Findata authority; - a short description of your research project (name and research field are sufficient); - a list of all the project members, added in cc to the email (please use only organizational email addresses).
  
3. Each project member should activate the account's additional security verification (or Multi-factor Authentication) by scanning the QR code with a specific application (e.g. Google Authenticator). For further instructions, see the [MFA paragraph](../../accounts/mfa.md) under the Account section on the CSC user guide;


4. Each project member should join the CSC project via the invitation link provided by the service desk and wait for approval;
  
 	
5. Fill in the [description of data processing activities](../../accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data.md) form;	 
  
 	 
6. All project members should approve [the terms and conditions of SD Desktop service](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md#member);	 
  
 	 
For specific guidance regarding these steps, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.	 
  
Note that you need to use your CSC username and password when you access data from your virtual desktop. If you don't remember your CSC password, you can [reset it](../../accounts/how-to-change-password.md) using the MyCSC portal.
  
 	 
## Default storage space and billing units consumption

Using SD Connect and SD Desktop is free of charge for research purposes, according to CSC's general terms of use: https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases However, CSC service consumes resources: billing units for their use and quota for storage space allocation. 

* Billing units:

A new CSC project includes about 10,000 billing units. You can find out how many billing units SD Desktop and Allas (for SD Connect user interface) will use with this [calculator](https://research.csc.fi/pricing). Here you can estimate the cost in billing units or euros. Once you have calculated how many billing units your project would need yearly, you can apply for more resources.


* SD Connect:

When you apply for a new CSC project and service access for SD Connect/Allas, the default quota (or storage space) for SD Connect is 10 TB, which can be increased to 200 TB if needed. If you work with larger datasets and your project requires additional storage space, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (Subject: sensitive data). Storing data in SD Connect/Allas consumes billing units. The rate is 1 BU/TiBh, i.e. 1 TB of data stored in Allas consumes 24 BU in a day and 8760 BU in a year.

* SD Desktop:

The default disk space (or storage space) in SD Desktop is 80 Gb and can be increased to 280 GB by adding an external volume during virtual desktop creation. If you need additional storage space for data analysis, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (Subject: Sensitive data). 
Analysing data in SD Desktop consumes billing units based on the type of virtual desktop you are using. The rate is 5,2 BU/h for the small computation option up to 52 BU/h for the heavy computation.

For further guidance regarding applying for additional quota or billing units, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.
