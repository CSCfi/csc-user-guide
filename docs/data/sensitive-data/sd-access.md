If you are a new Sensitive Data (SD) services user, this section is for you. Here you learn how to create an account and a CSC project. You will learn also how to manage your project's resources consumption (here called billing unit), storage space and what happens to your data upon project closure.

The steps you need to follow depend on your role in the research team:

### Project Manager

The project manager is the primary user of a CSC project, responsible for managing the project and project members members. They act as the data controller (or academic organization representative).

Responsibilities include:

* Creating and managing CSC projects in the MyCSC portal.
  
* Adding and managing project members.
  
* Managing project lifetime, storage space, and resources (here called billing units).
  
* Deciding which services are suitable for data processing by adding services in the MYCSC portal.
  
* Exporting data from SD Desktop (only project managers can do this).


### Project Member

The project member is a person who joins to existing CSC project (can only be added by the project manager).
  
* All project members have equal access to the project's content (e.g. data access).
  
* **SD Connect:** project members can upload, download and delete files same way as project manager.
  
* **SD Desktop:** project members can upload data and analyze it, but they can not export anything from SD Desktop. Only the project manager can export data from SD Desktop.
  
* Project mebers can not add services via the MyCSC portal.
