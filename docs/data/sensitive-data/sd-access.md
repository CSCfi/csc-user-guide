## Understanding roles in a CSC Project

The steps you need to follow depend on your role in the research team:

### Project Manager

The project manager is the primary user of a CSC project, responsible for managing the project and its members. They act as the data controller (or academic organization representative).

Responsibilities include:

* Creating and managing CSC projects in the MyCSC portal
  
* Adding and managing project members
  
* Managing project lifetime, storage space, and resources (here called billing units)
  
* Deciding which services are suitable for data processing by adding services in the MYCSC portal
  
* Exporting data from SD Desktop (only project managers can do this)


### Project Member


* Project member is a person who joins to existing CSC project (can only be added by the project manager)
  
* All project members have equal access to the project's content (e.g. data access)
  
* **SD Connect:** project members can upload, download and delete files same way as project manager.
  
* **SD Desktop:** project members can upload data and analyze it, but they can not export anything from SD Desktop. Only the project manager can export data from SD Desktop.
  
* Projetc mebers can not add services via the MYCSC portal.
