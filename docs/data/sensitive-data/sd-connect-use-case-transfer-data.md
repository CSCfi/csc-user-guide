# Use case: Transfer your data to another project

A project team (project A) has valuable datasets that another team (recipient project B) needs for analysis. Project A shares the relevant data folder with the recipient project B with **Read-only** permission. This allows the recipient project members to download a copy of data, ensuring they have their own working copy for analysis without affecting the original dataset.

1. Log in to SD Connect.
2. Choose project A in the top left corner.
3. In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row on the right, click **Share**.
4. In the new window, add the [Share ID](./sd-connect-share.md) of the recipient project B and select the permission level **Read-only**. Click **Share**.
5. All the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient project B. All project members in project B can now copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. Additionally, they can access it via SD Desktop for analysis.
