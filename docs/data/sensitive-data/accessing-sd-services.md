# Accessing Sensitive Data (SD) services 	 
  
 	 
  
CSC's Sensitive Data services are suitable for managing sensitive data from any research field and for diverse purposes. The services are available to researchers and students affiliated with Finnish higher education institutions (universities, universities of applied sciences), or a state research institute. This is based on the agreement made with the Ministry of Education and Culture. CSC's Sensitive Data services are free of charge according to [CSC's General terms of use ](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use). 

Below you can find more information on the steps required to access SD service to process research data and register data, storage space availability, and resource (or billing units) consumption. 
  
You can browse through the main topics of the manual using the navigation bar on the left side of this page or the search function.	 
  

## Processing sensitive research data
 	 
  
To access CSC's services for sensitive research data processing:
 

 1. Create a user account using the [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) portal.  
  
 2. Create or join a CSC project and add project members.	 
  
 
 3. Fill in the _Description of processing activities form_ and accept CSC's _Data Processing Agreement_.	 
  
 	
 4. All project members need to add service access to Allas (to use SD Connect) and SD Desktop.	 
  
 	
 5. All project members need to activate thier account's additional security verification (or Multi-factor Authentication) by scanning the QR code with an application (e.g. Google Authenticator).	 
  
 6. Apply for billing units or disk quota.	 
  
 	
For video tutorials and guidance regarding these steps, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.	 
  
 	 
  
Once you have completed these steps, you can log in to SD services with identity federation systems (Haka, Virtu, CSC Login, or LSLogin) at:	 
  
 	
 * [https://sd-connect.csc.fi](https://sd-connect.csc.fi) 	 
  
 * [https://sd-desktop.csc.fi](https://sd-desktop.csc.fi)	 
  
 	 
  
with any modern web-browser (note: SD Connect is not support private browsing). 

  
!!! Note	 
    1) LSLogin (LifeScience login, previously known as ELIXIR login) is available only after linking your CSC account to your LifeScience account (under your profile in MyCSC). 2) You need to use your CSC credentials (username and password) to access data from your virtual desktop. If you don't remember your CSC password, you can [reset it](../../accounts/how-to-change-password.md).	 

 	 
  
## Processing register data under the Act of Secondary Use	 
  
 	 
  
Processing register data for secondary use differs from the abovementioned process. In this case, access to the SD Desktop computing environment is managed by CSC's helpdesk in accordance with the Finnish Act on the Secondary use of health and social data and Findata authority regulations. 	 
  
Currently, processing only register data provided by the Fidata authority is possible. For more information about data provided by single registers, contact us at: servicedesk@csc.fi (Sensitive Data).	 
 
!!! Note 	 
  
 Processing of register data is subject to several limitations. In this case, the SD Desktop computing environment might not be suitable for your needs or the software needed for data analysis might not be available as a default program. For this reason, we recommend you contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi before applying for a data permit from Findata or a register to understand if this workflow suits your needs.	 
  
 To access SD Desktop for processing register data:
  
1. Create a[a CSC account](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md) using the [My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi): log in with Haka, if you don't have Haka credentials you need to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi in order to verify your identity;	 
   
  
2. Request a CSC project from servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive Data). Attach a copy of the Findata permit data permit; describe shortly your research project (name and research field are enough) and add all the project members as a cc to the email (please use the organizational email addresses).	 
  
 	 
3. Activate your account's additional security verification (or Multi-factor Authentication) by scanning the QR code with a specific application (e.g. Google Authenticator). For further instructions see the [MFA paragraph](../../accounts/mfa.md), under the Account section on the CSC user guide;	 
  
 	 
4. Join a CSC project via the invitation link provided to you by the service desk and wait for approval;	 
  
 	
5. Fill in the [description of data processing activities](../../accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data.md) form;	 
  
 	 
6. All project members should approve [the terms and conditions of SD Desktop service](../../accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md#member);	 
  
 	 
  
For specific guidance regarding these steps, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.	 
  
Note that you need to use your CSC username and password when you access data from your virtual desktop. If you don't remember your CSC password, you can [reset it](../../accounts/how-to-change-password.md).	 
  
 	 
  
 	 
 ## Default storage space and billing units consumption


### SD Connect:

The default quota (or storage space) for SD Connect is 10 TB, which can be increased up to 200 TB if needed. If you work with larger datasets, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (Subject: Sensitive data).
Storing data in SD Connect/Allas consumes billing units. In Allas, billing is based on the amount of data stored. The rate is 1 BU/TiBh, i.e. 1 TB of data stored in Allas consumes 24 BU in a day and 8760 BU in a year.

### SD Desktop:

The default disk space (or storage space) in SD Desktop is 80 GB, and can be increased up  to 280 GB by adding an external volume during virtual desktop creation. If you work with larger datasets, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (Subject: Sensitive data).

Analysing data in SD Desktop consumes billing units, and this is based on the type of virtual desktop you are using. The rate is 5,2 BU/h for the small computation option up to 52 BU/h for the heavy computation. 

For specific guidance regarding applying for additional quota or billing units, check the [Accounts](../../accounts/index.md) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide.
