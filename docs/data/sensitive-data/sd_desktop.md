# SD Desktop (Sensitive Data Desktop)


## Before you start

* Independently of the login method used, you need a **CSC username and password to import data** into your Desktop computing environment. If you don't remember it, check how to reset it at [Account: How to change password](../../accounts/how-to-change-password.md)


* **All the project members belonging to a specific CSC project can access the same computing environment in SD Desktop.** Currently, it is possible to **launch 3 Desktops (or workspaces) for each CSC project**. Each CSC project has its own virtual private computing environment and **each computing environment is isolated from other CSC projects or CSC accounts, unless you authorize it**.

* It is the project manager's or group leader's responsibility to review frequently the list of members belonging to a project in MyCSC and verify who can access the data present in the project using SD Desktop or SD Connect. Remove the project members that do not need to have access to the data when their contribution is no longer needed.  

* SD Connect and SD Desktop have not yet been security audited. Because of that, users may not process any personal data granted for the purposes of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (552/2019) by Findata.

## Launching a private  Desktop
  
<iframe width="280" height="155"srcdoc="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VebHTUonOSs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  
After launch, you can login into your Desktop from any modern internet browser. Each Desktop will be accessible all along the duration of your CSC project.

Each Desktop is CSC project specific. Thus, if you add colleagues/collaborators as project members in the same CSC project, they will be able to access the same Desktop. To edit the same files or datasets, you need to save them in the same *shared folder*.

<img width="574" alt="space" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/122592729-5b7f1580-d06d-11eb-8913-9219c864954b.png">

To launch your Desktop, in Homepage, click on **Go To Launching Page** :

* **select your CSC project**;

* **choose the operating system** (for beta versions, only possible operating system is Linux CentOS 7);
  
* optionally, you can name the Desktop;
  
* optionally, you can extend the disk space clicking on **add an external disk**. You can add up to 200 GB. The default disk space is 80 GB. Note: you can extend the disk space only before launching the Desktop;

* **select** the preferred computing environment (based on your needs) and click on **Launch Desktop**;

The system will create a secure connection to your private computing environment. The process is completely automated and might take **up to 30 minutes**. 

In SD Desktop (Open Beta) you can choose between **four different Desktops **:  

|Desktop |Core|Memory<br/>(GiB)|Root<br/>disk<br/>(GB)|Correspondent Flavour|Example usage|Billing<br/>Units<br/>/h|
|--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Light computation |3|4 |80 |standard.medium |testing the service |1.3|
|Small computation |6|15|80 |standard.xlarge |office software|5.2|
|Medium computation|8|30|80 |standard.xxlarge |running statistical or genome analysis |10.4|
|Heavy computation |8|168|80 |hpc4.40core|non-interactive programmatic computation|78|


If you are not sure what is the best option for your needs/research, contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi (email subject: SD Desktop). Do not choose the Heavy computation option for simple computing or analysis, as it consumes a large amount of resources.

All the Desktop are provided with the same software. The complete and updated list can be found in the following paragraph: [Pre-installed list of software](./pre-installed_software.md).

In the Desktop you will be able to access different applications from the menu bar on the page top left corner (e.g. Open Office, Jupter Notebook ).
If you need to work on files or datasets with your colleagues, save them in the **Shared-directory**. The file will be visible and accessible to all the members of the same CSC project. 

As previously mentioned, you can **logout** from your computing environment at any moment (in the workspace view, top right corner of the browser, select your username and log out). Logging out will disconnect the work session. You will always be able to access your Desktop again after logging in. **Never use the lock or reboot buttons** in SD Desktop as after that you will not be able to connect to the Desktop again.

## Accessing encrypted sensitive data within SD Desktop


As the virtual Desktop is isolated from the Internet, the only way to access data for analysis is utilizing a specific application called Data Gateway.
This application will allow you to access encrypted data stored in SD Connect or a specific dataset for which you have been granted access via SD Apply for re-use.
Encrypted files will be **visible in read-only mode (similarly to opening a pdf file or streaming a YouTube video)**. This solution allows you to process large amounts of data without storing any copy on your virtual Desktop. 


!!! Note
    In SD Desktop, you  can access only files encrypted with the Sensitive Data Services encryption key or using SD Connect. If you try to access unencrypted data or files encrypted only with your public encryption key, this will result in an error. If you experience any problem with Desktops launched before March 2022, don't hesitate to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: sensitive data). 
   
### Accessing encrypted data stored in SD Connect using Data Gateway

Once you sign in to your virtual Desktop, you can access encrypted data stored in SD Connect by following these steps:

* Open **Data Gateway** (you can find the application on your Desktop);

* select SD Connect;

* add your **CSC credentials** (username and password. Note: we disabled the copy/paste options for security reasons; thus, you need to type in your password);

* **Click on Login** and next clic on **Continue**;

![data gateway 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158681590-1754a9e5-881f-4dc6-9752-8aa81c7b69e6.png)

![data gateway 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158686613-e9889bc1-7865-4e74-966d-3cf65972ab52.png)


* In the new window, at the end of the page, click on **create Data Gateway**. The application will create a new folder called **Projects** accessible from your Desktop or programmatically the terminal. Next, click on **Open folder**.

![data gateway 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158682331-183db935-3380-4e30-84c8-1f91508da9e8.png)

![data gateway 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158682773-68e05a99-95dc-435e-a643-de8af5021f6f.png)


*   If the files have been encrypted using SD Connect or the **sensitive data public encryption key**, you will be able to access their content in read-only mode. The current streaming speed can be up to 50 MB/s. 

![data gateway 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158682863-a82bdffa-0e3c-4888-a11e-15f32d4841dc.png)

![data gateway 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158682916-0db649e9-6bf1-4ed4-930f-8a4c93e1a93e.png)


!!! Note 
    The Projects folder is **available only when the Data Gateway application is open**. If you sign out from the application, you will not access the data stored in other Sensitive Data services unless you previously made a full copy of it inside your Desktop. Thus, Data Gateway needs to be open during data processing in streaming mode.



### Importing data inside the Desktop

**If you need to edit the files/data**:

 * access the files of interest in the Project folder **using Data Gateway**;
 
 *  Select all the necessary files from the Project folder, make a **copy** and save it in the virtual Desktop **home directory** (the files will be visible only from your browser) or in the **shared folder** (in this case, the files will be accessible also by all the CSC project members). 

 
!!! Note
    Your private workspace in SD Desktop is completely isolated from the Internet for security reasons. If you need to visualize or import specific scripts into your Desktop (for example, from GitHub or other trusted repositories), you can use the procedure described above.


###  Accessing published data under controlled access via SD Apply


Data Gateway can also be used to access data published under controlled access via other CSC services for sensitive data. To access a specific dataset in your virtual Desktop, you need first to apply for it using SD Apply service. When the data owner (or Data Access Committee) has granted you access, you will be able to access the dataset in SD Desktop for a limited time.

<img width="960" alt="Screenshot 2022-03-16 222235" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158684026-959e7b8d-d910-4a77-919a-414c8623b8ec.png">

If you did not yet apply for access to a specific dataset or if the access period has ended and you try to access the data using the Data gateway application, you will encounter an error message. 

<img width="960" alt="10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83574067/158683211-3a390e9e-f576-4a2b-8638-07c399c1b4fe.png">


SD Apply is currently in the pilot phase. Please contact us at servidesk@csc.fi (subject: sensitive data) for more information.


 
## RStudio in SD Desktop
