# Service access: How to start using SD Desktop

When you are processing secondary use data from a public registry, access to SD Desktop is managed by CSC. To start using SD Desktop for secondary use, you need to:

1. Request a CSC project by sending an email to servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive Data). Please,

   * attach a copy of your **data permit** to the request,
   * describe shortly your research project (name and research field are enough),
   * add all the project members as a cc to the email (please use the organisational email addresses).

2. Set up [a CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) using the [My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi/): log in with **Haka**, if you don't have Haka credentials you need to contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi in order to verify your identity;
3. Activate the **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on your account by scanning the QR-code with a specific application (e.g. Google Authenticator). For further instructions see the [MFA paragraph](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/mfa/), under the *Account*-section on the CSC user guide;
4. Join a CSC project via an invitation link and wait for an approval from the service desk;
5. Fill in the [description of data processing activities form](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data/);
6. Approve [the terms and conditions of SD Desktop service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/#member);

For specific guidance regarding these steps check the [Accounts](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/) paragraph at the beginning of this user guide. Note that you always need to use your CSC username and password when you access data from your virtual Desktop. If you don't remember your CSC password, you can [reset it](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-change-password/).
