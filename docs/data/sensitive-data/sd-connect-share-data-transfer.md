Data transfer
Use case example: A project team (Project A) has valuable datasets that another team (Recipient project B) needs for analysis. Project A shares the relevant data folder with the Recipient Project with make a copy permission, granting them the ability to make a copy. This allows the Recipient Project members to download a copy of data, ensuring they have their own working copy for analysis without affecting the original dataset.

To transfer encrypted files to another CSC project please follow these steps:

Select CSC project: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose the relevant CSC project in the top left corner.

Share folder: In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row (right-side), click on Share. In the new window, input the Share ID of recipient project and select the permission level: make a copy. Click on Share to proceed.

Now, all the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient CSC projects. All project members can copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. Additionally, they can access it via SD Desktop for analysis.
