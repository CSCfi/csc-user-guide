## Default storage space and billing units consumption

Using SD Connect and SD Desktop is free for research purposes, according to [CSC's general terms of use](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases). However, CSC's services consume resources: 

* billing units (BUs) for their use;

* and quota for storage space allocation.

**A new CSC project includes about 10,000 billing units.** With the calculator below, you can determine how many billing units your CSC project will consume and apply for more resources.


**SD Connect**: when you apply for a new CSC project, the default quota (or storage space) for SD Connect/Allas is 10 TB, which can be increased up to 200 TB if needed. If your project requires additional storage space, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive data). 

Storing data in SD Connect/Allas consumes billing units. The rate is: 

* 1 billing unit/TBh.

i.e. 1 TB of data stored in Allas consumes 24 billing units daily and 8760 billing units per year.

**SD Desktop**: the default disk space (or storage space) in SD Desktop is 80 GB and can be increased up to 280 GB by adding an external volume during virtual desktop creation. If you need additional storage space for data analysis, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive data). 

Analysing data in SD Desktop consumes billing units based on the type of virtual desktop you are using. The rate is:

* Light computation: 1.3 billing units/hour;

* Small computation: 5.2 billing units/hour;

* Medium computation: 10.4 billing units/hour;

* Heavy computation: 52 billing units/hour.


For more information, see the specific sections: 

* [applying for billing units](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) 

* and [increasing quotas](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).


## Restricted service access when billing units have been consumed

When all billing units in your CSC project have been consumed, SD Desktop service usage will be limited: all running virtual Desktops will be automatically paused, and it will not be possible to access their content. No data is deleted when the total amount of billing units is zero or negative. 

You will receive a notification via email, and you can regain access to your virtual Desktop by following these steps: 

1- Please apply for additional billing units using the MYCSC portal (to obtain a positive saldo);
2- Log in to SD Desktop and restart the virtual Desktop. For more guidance, see intructions in the service [user guide](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#pausing-or-restarting-a-virtual-desktop).
