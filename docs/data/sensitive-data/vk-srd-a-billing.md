## Default storage space and billing units consumption

Using SD Connect and SD Desktop is free for research purposes, according to [CSC's general terms of use](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases). However, CSC's services consume resources: 

* billing units (BUs) for their use;

* and quota for storage space allocation.

**A new CSC project includes about 10,000 billing units.** With the calculator below, you can determine how many billing units your CSC project will consume and apply for more resources.


**SD Connect**: when you apply for a new CSC project, the default quota (or storage space) for SD Connect/Allas is 10 TB, which can be increased up to 200 TB if needed. If your project requires additional storage space, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive data). 

Storing data in SD Connect/Allas consumes billing units. The rate is: 

* 1 billing unit/TBh.

i.e. 1 TB of data stored in Allas consumes 24 billing units daily and 8760 billing units per year.

**SD Desktop**: the default disk space (or storage space) in SD Desktop is 80 GB and can be increased up to 280 GB by adding an external volume during virtual desktop creation. If you need additional storage space for data analysis, contact us for support at servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive data). 

Analysing data in SD Desktop consumes billing units based on the type of virtual desktop you are using. The rate is:

* Light computation: 1.3 billing units/hour;

* Small computation: 5.2 billing units/hour;

* Medium computation: 10.4 billing units/hour;

* Heavy computation: 52 billing units/hour.


For more information, see the specific sections: 

* [applying for billing units](../../accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) 

* and [increasing quotas](../../accounts/how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md).

## What happens to your data when your CSC project expires or is closed

When your CSC project reaches its expiration date or is closed, there are a few important things to know about your data:

* **Service Discontinuation**: both SD Connect and SD Desktop services will be disabled, and you won't be able to access them anymore.

* **Data Deletion**: Any data stored within these services, including files, virtual desktops, and volumes, will be permanently removed after 90 days from the project's closure. This measure is in place to ensure the secure handling of your data, aligning with CSC's policies.

* **Notification**: We'll keep you informed about the status of your project. You'll receive an email notification when your project is about to expire, so you can plan accordingly. For example, you can apply for a project lifetime extension of one year loggin in to [MyCSC portal](https://my.csc.fi).

!!! Note
    Please note that all content within the services will be permanently deleted 90 days after the project is closed, and once deleted, it cannot be restored or recovered.




## Restricted service access when billing units have been consumed

When all billing units in your CSC project have been consumed, SD Desktop service usage will be limited: all running virtual Desktops will be automatically paused, and it will not be possible to access their content. No data is deleted when the total amount of billing units is zero or negative. 

You will receive a notification via email, and you can regain access to your virtual Desktop by following these steps: 

1- Please apply for additional billing units using the MYCSC portal (to obtain a positive saldo);
2- Log in to SD Desktop and restart the virtual Desktop. For more guidance, see intructions in the service [user guide](../../data/sensitive-data/sd_desktop.md#pausing-or-restarting-a-virtual-desktop).
