# Reuse with Sensitive Data Apply

Sensitive Data (SD) Apply is a service for applying access rights to sensitive datasets stored at CSC. In practice, it is a simple web user interface that guides you during the application process.

Each sensitive dataset that is published under controlled access is associated with a Data Access Committee (DAC). The DAC is a body of one or more named individuals who are responsible for granting data access to external applicants (or requesters) based on specific policies. SD Apply facilitates the communication between a data applicant and the DAC by automating the application process, ensuring the availability of the necessary information and providing a record of the application history. Once the application has been reviewed and approved, the data applicant can directly analyze the datasets in SD Desktop â€“ a cloud computing environment part of [CSC Sensitive Data Services for research](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data-services-for-research).

The following is a step-by-step guide to SD Apply that illustrates:
