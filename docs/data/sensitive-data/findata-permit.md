- Before activating MFA you need to have some authentication application on your mobile phone, for example Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.
- Click **Enable MFA** in **Project notifications** window in top right corner or go to the **Profile** page (Left side menu or top right hamburger menu).
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication by clicking **“Activate”**.
- This will create a QR code which you can read with your authentication application (for example Google Authenticator).
- Your authentication application will provide a verification code which you can now write to MyCSC **“Verification code”** field and click **“Verify”**.
