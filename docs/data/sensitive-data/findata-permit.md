- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication by clicking **“Activate”**.
- This will create a QR code which you can read with your authentication application (for example Google Authenticator).
- Your authentication application will provide a verification code which you can now write to MyCSC **“Verification code”** field and click **“Verify”**.
