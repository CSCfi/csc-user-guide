# How to get access to SD Desktop with a Findata permit

!!! Note
    As Findata states in their data permits, the permit holder must check that the disclosed data corresponds with the permit as soon as possible after receiving access to the disclosed data. A suspected errors must be reported to the data permit authority within 3 months of the permit holder having obtained access to the disclosed data. **The 3 month period to report errors starts already, when Findata transfers the data to CSC,** regardless of whether the permit holder has a virtual machine ready to access the data or not. Thus, we recommend starting the preparations for the data access early on.
