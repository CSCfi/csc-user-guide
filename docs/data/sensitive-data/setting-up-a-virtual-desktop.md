# Setting up a virtual Desktop

To start your virtual Desktop, log in to the services at [sd-desktop.csc.fi](sd-desktop.csc.fi) and click on **Go to SD Desktop management page**.

Here you can specify several parameters:

 * **Select your CSC project.**
 * **Choose the operating system.** Currently the available operating systems are Linux CentOS 7 an Linux Ubuntu.
 * **Assign a name for your virtual Desktop.** It is good practice to assign a descriptive name for a Desktop so that all project members can easily identify it later on.
 * Choose one of the **virtual Desktop pre-built options** (Small, Medium or Heavy computing), based on your computing and memory needs. The default disk space for all Desktops is 80 GB. You can extend your Desktop disk space by selecting the option *add an external disk*. You can add up to 200 GB.

!!! Note 
    You can't extend the disk space anymore after you have launched the virtual Desktop. Additional disk space later on can be requested by writing to servicedesk@csc.fi (subject: Sensitive data);

When all the settings are done, press the **Launch Desktop** button. The launch operation is entirely automated and can take **up to 30 minutes**. If you try to access the virtual Desktop and see a black screen, come back later.


## Pre-built virtual Desktop options

#### Small computation
 * Technical specifications: **Core: 6; memory 15 GB; Root disk: 80 GB; Correspondent Pouta Flavour: standar.xlarge; Billing Units: 5.2 units/h.**
 * This option is ideal for analysing sensitive data using office software (for example: similar to simple statistical analysis, watching videos, listening to audio files, working on text files).
 * You can compare this Desktop to your standard working laptop.
#### Medium computation
 * Technical specifications: **Core: 8; memory 30 GB; Root disk: 80 GB; Correspondent Pouta Flavour: standar.xxlarge; Billing Units: 10.4 units/h.**
 * This option is ideal for running complex statistical or genome analysis.
 * You can compare this Desktop to a powerful laptop provided by your IT unit.
#### Heavy computation
 * Technical specifications: **Core: 32; memory 116 GiB; Root disk: 80 GB; Correspondent Pouta Flavour: hpc.5.32core; Billing Units: 52 units/h.**
 * This option is ideal for running non-interactive programmatic analysis (for example, machine learning) that require heavy computation.
 * Please do not choose this option for simple analysis, as it consumes a lot of resources.
