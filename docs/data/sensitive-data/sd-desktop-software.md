# Default software available on SD Desktop

Upon logging in to the virtual desktop, you'll find a standard set of software ready to use. This foundational toolkit ensures you can start working immediately and is based on a limited set of default open-source software. However, the virtual desktop can also become a versatile research workspace designed to adapt to your specific needs **via customization with**:

* SD Installer: A simple application for easy software additions.
  
* Apptainer and Podman: For those with technical expertise, create customized containers for specialized software setups.

If the list below is not clear, or you need specific software to analyze your data, please don't hesitate to contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive Data). We can support you in your Desktop customization. Moreover, we are working on developing our services to provide proprietary software. Follow our webpage for constant updates.

## SD Software installer

[SD Software installer](./tutorials/sd-software-installer.md) provides an easy-to-use tool to add some commonly used software to SD Desktop.

## Software customisation with Apptainer and Podman

Users can install their own software to SD Desktop, but this requires technical expertise. As SD Desktop is isolated from the internet, you can't directly use installation tools like _git_, _coda_, _cpan_ or _pip_ as they are dependent on internet connections to external repositories. Further, SD Desktop users can't do any operation that needs superuser access.

If you want to add new software to your virtual machine independently, the most convenient way to add new software to your SD Desktop is to build an Apptainer container outside SD Desktop and then import the container through SD Connect to SD Desktop. The two documents below describe two sample cases on adding software with containers.

   1. [Importing ready-made software containers from a public repository to SD Desktop](./sd-desktop-singularity.md)
   2. [Creating you own Singularity container and importing it to SD Desktop](./creating_containers.md)


!!! Note
    Please don't hesitate to contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) (subject: Sensitive Data). We can support you in your Desktop customization. 

In Ubuntu22-based virtual machines you can use also Podman container manager. One of the benefits of Podman is that it can utilize Docker containers too.
