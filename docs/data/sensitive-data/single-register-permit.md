* Login to SD Apply: [https://sd-apply.csc.fi](https://sd-apply.csc.fi). Log in using the same method as when logging in to SD Desktop (CSC credentials or Haka). Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply, because all your actions are connected to your login identity.

#### Catalogue page
