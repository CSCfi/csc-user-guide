After creating the project in MyCSC, you need to apply for access to the dataset in SD Apply. This is a technical security step and does not affect the permission granted in the data permit.

* You have received a message from the controller that your data is available in the SD Apply service
* Login to SD Apply: [https://sd-apply.csc.fi](https://sd-apply.csc.fi). Log in using the same method as when logging in to SD Desktop (CSC credentials or Haka). Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply, because all your actions are connected to your login identity.

#### Catalogue page
* On the Catalogue page, under Apply for access, find the material you want and click **''Add to cart''**. 
* The material is now in the shopping cart. Click **''Apply''**.
