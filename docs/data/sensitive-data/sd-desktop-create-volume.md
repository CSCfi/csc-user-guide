# Create volumes (virtual external hard drive)

A volume is like a virtual USB stick used to store your data. You can attach it to one virtual desktop or move it between desktops that belong to the same CSC project as needed. This can be compared to connecting/disconnecting a USB stick to/from your laptop. This feature is available only on desktops created after February 2023. For additional details, refer to: [Managing volumes](./sd-desktop-manage-volume.md).

!!! Note
    Itâ€™s recommended to save critical analyses or files on the volume, which can also act as a backup if the virtual desktop becomes unresponsive. Please note that after the virtual desktop is set up, the volume can only be extended with additional storage if no data or files have been saved on it. To request an extension, contact [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md), *(subject: SD Desktop)*.

### In Create volume window 

1. Select name for your volume. A descriptive name is useful, especially if you are working on multiple projects. Note, that the name should only include letters or numbers, and you shouldn't use special characters or spaces in the name.

2. Choose from the available options that covers the combined size of your dataset and working files. If you are unsure about which volume size you should choose, send an email to [CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).

3. (optional) Write description or note about the volume for your team. This helps other team members understand its purpose and contents.

4. Click **Create**. The window will now close and volume creation will start.

After returning to the main page, you will see a data table displaying the volumes in your project.
