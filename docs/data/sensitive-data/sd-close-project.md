# Closing CSC project

Default lifetime for the project is **one year**. [Project manager](#step-by-step-tutorial-for-project-manager) can extend project's lifetime or close the project in [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi){ target="_blank" }. If project lifetime ends, it will be closed automatically. You'll receive an email notification when your project is about to expire, so please keep your contact information up to date in MyCSC.

## What happens to your data after the CSC project expires or is closed

* **Services will be disabled**: SD Connect and SD Desktop services will be disabled, and you won't be able to access them anymore.

* **Data will be deleted after 90 days**: Any data stored within SD Connect or SD Desktop, including files, virtual desktops, and volumes, will be permanently removed after 90 days from the project's closure. This measure is in place to ensure the secure handling of your data, aligning with CSC's policies.

!!! Note
    All **content within the services will be permanently deleted 90 days** after the project is closed. Once deleted, it cannot be restored or recovered.
