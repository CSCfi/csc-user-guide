# How to use folder as your shared workspace with SD Connect

## Use case

You (Team A) and other team (Team B) are actively collaborating. You both want to upload data to the same folder and be able to modify folder content.

## Solution

In this case you can share your data folder to Team B with **Collaborate** -permission. That way both teams have equal rights to modify files inside the shared folder.

## Step by step tutorial

Both teams should have their own CSC project and SD Connect activated. If you don't have one yet, please follow instructions from [Start here](sd-access.md) and return to this tutorial after you have set up the CSC project.

1. Ask from Team B for their Share ID. They find it from their SD Connect.

2. Log in to [SD Connect](./sd-connect-login.md).
3. Upload your data folder to SD Connect: [See upload instructions](./sd-connect-upload.md). Or create an empty folder by clicking "**Create folder**".

Now all the content of the folder is accessible for both projects (Project A and Project B). All members in both projects can modify the content of the folder via SD Connect; Everyone can upload, download, copy and delete the content as they wish. They can also access it via SD Desktop for analysis.
