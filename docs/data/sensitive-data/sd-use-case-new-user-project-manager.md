#### 2.4 Apply Billing Units for your project


!!! default "Billing Units"

     **Every active CSC project consumes both Billing Units (BUs) and storage quota.** 
     
     **Billing Units (BUs)** are used to track how much computing power and processing time your project consumes. CSC uses different types of Billing Units to measure resource usage based on the service:
     
     - **SD Desktop** consumes **Cloud Billing Units** type, which reflect the use of virtual desktops and compute resources
     - **SD Connect** consumes **Storage Billing Units** type, which reflect the amount of data stored in CSC’s cloud infrastructure.
     - 30 000 Cloud and Storage BUs is usually enough for initial testing. You can [apply for more billing units](#4-apply-for-more-billing-units) in MyCSC portal.
     
     **The quota** limits the amount of storage space available. Default quota (or storage space) for each CSC project with for SD Connect enabled is 10 TB, which you can expand up to 200 TB as needed by contacting service desk (subject: Increase Allas quota).

     [More information about billing units](./sd-billing-units.md)

- Select **S 30 000 BUs** under Cloud Resource Package.

- Next, you need to fill in two more fields: Short overview of (expected) results and Program, software, methods used. Press **Next**.
- In the last view, you can review the project description and field on science. Finally, you can click **Submit**.
