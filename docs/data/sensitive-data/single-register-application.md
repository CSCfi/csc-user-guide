# Applying for access to secondary use single register data with SD Apply

These instructions are for researchers who have received a permit for the secondary use of social and health data directly from a single public register, i.e. the permit is not from Findata, and the permit is issued for SD Desktop.

After receiving the permit from the data controller, the researchers need to apply for access to the correct dataset in SD Apply. This is a technical security step and does not affect the permission granted in the data permit. All the project members must be added to the application in order to be able to access the data on SD Desktop.

First, the users need to set up a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) with Haka credentials using the [My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi/). In addition to sending this application in SD Apply, the project PI needs to request a CSC project from the CSC service desk, more instructions on [user guide for SD Desktop for secondary use](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-audited/#service-access).

Application process step by step:

1. Log in to [SD Apply](https://sd-apply.csc.fi/).
2. Find the correct dataset from the Registry Datasets catalogue list and add it to cart. You should have received the identification information from the data controller. Usually the name of the dataset corresponds with the  identifier of the organisation (same as their email domain) combined with the journal number of your data permit. The datasets are grouped in the catalogue by organisation using Haka and Virtu identifiers.
3. Press the Apply button in the cart to open the application form. All of the project members need to apply for access in SD Apply, and the most convenient way is to invite everyone to join the same application, with the ‘Invite member…’ function in the application form. Then you can save the application as a draft, everyone can log in and accept the terms of use, and after that, you can send the application.
4. You will receive an email, when the data controller has approved the application.
5. When the application is approved, export the application PDF from SD Apply and send that to the CSC servicedesk to finalise the linkage of your data and the CSC project created for you.
6. When you have received confirmation that all of these steps are completed, and SD Desktop service has been added to your project, you can access the data on SD Desktop.
