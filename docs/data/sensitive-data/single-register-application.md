# Applying for access to secondary use single register data with SD Apply

These instructions are for researchers who have received a permit for the secondary use of social and health data directly from a single public register, i.e. the permit is not from Findata, and the permit is issued for SD Desktop.

After receiving the permit from the data controller, you need to apply for access to the correct dataset in SD Apply. This is a technical security step and does not affect the permission granted in the data permit. All the project members need to be added to the application in order to be able to access the data on SD Desktop.

First, you need to set up a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) with Haka credentials using the [My CSC portal](https://my.csc.fi/). In addition to sending this application in SD Apply, the project PI needs to request a CSC project from the CSC service desk, more instructions on [user guide for SD Desktop for secondary use](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-audited/#service-access).

## Application process

### Step 1: Login

Log in to SD Apply at <https://sd-apply.csc.fi/>. Login to SD Apply is possible either with user identity federation systems (Haka or Virtu login) or with CSC account.

!!! note
    Always use the same identity provider when you log in to SD Apply because all your actions are connected to your login identity.

### Step 2: Apply for access

After login, you will access the SD Apply "Catalogue" page. On this page, you can search for a specific dataset and start the application process. Start a new application by clicking on *Add to cart* next to the name of the dataset. By clicking on *Apply*, you will be redirected to the application form.

You can find the correct dataset from the Registry Datasets catalogue list with the identification information provided by the data controller. Usually the name of the dataset corresponds with the identifier of the organisation (same as their email domain) combined with the journal number of your data permit. The datasets are grouped in the catalogue by organisation.

### Step 3: Submit the application

Follow the instructions on the application form and fill in the required fields:

- **State**. Contains basic details like title and state of your application.

- **Applicants**. Everyone who has been granted access in the data permit must be named in the Applicants field. Members can be added, changed, or removed without re-applying. You can invite other people to join the data access application by selecting Invite member and providing their names and email addresses. They will then get an invitation email. By following the invitation link, they can log in to SD Apply and accept the terms of use. When the application is approved, all members of the application will be granted access to the same dataset.

- **Resources**. Shows the datasets you are applying for.

- **Terms of use**. Lists all the licenses defining the terms and conditions for data access. To access, click on Accept terms of use.

- **Application**. Access to a secondary use dataset is granted only based on the data permit. Provide the possible verification information requested by the data controller here.

To submit your application, select *Send application* under Actions. Unfortunately, editing or deleting the application is no more possible after sending the application. However, removing members is still possible.

### Step 4: Wait for approval

After you have sent the application, it will be forwarded to the data controller, who approves or rejects it. During the approval process, the data controller can:

- approve or reject your application.

- return the application asking for additional information.

- close your application and cancel the application process.

- add comments to your application.

You can follow the approval process and read the possible comments from the "Events" section of the application. In addition, you can find all your applications and see their state from the "Applications" tab:

- **Draft**. Your application is still a draft and cannot be seen by the data controller. You can continue working on your application or delete it entirely from the system.

- **Submitted**. The application has been sent to the data controller and cannot be edited anymore unless specifically requested.

- **Approved**. The application has been approved, and you have been granted access rights.

- **Rejected**. To see why your application was rejected, navigate the application and select View. Data controller comments will be shown in the Events section.

- **Returned**. If the data controller needs additional information regarding your application or if the , they can return your application to you. To edit the application, follow the link in the email or log in to SD Apply, navigate to the application, and select *View*. You can see the comments of the data controller in the Events section. Then, make the changes and select *Send application*.

- **Revoked**. Your Application, and thus your access rights, have been revoked by the data controller.

You will receive an email notification whenever the state of your application changes.

### Step 5: Finalise the linkage of the data and your CSC project

Once your application has been approved, you will receive a notification and further instructions via email. In addition, export the application PDF from SD Apply and send it to the CSC service desk to finalise the linkage of your data and the CSC project created for you.

### Step 6: Set up your Desktop to access the data

When you have received confirmation that all of these steps are completed, and SD Desktop service has been added to your project, you can access the data on SD Desktop. You can continue following the instructions on [user guide for SD Desktop for secondary use](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/sd-desktop-audited/#service-access).
