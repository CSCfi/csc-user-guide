!!! Warning
    If you encounter the message 'Requested files could not be decrypted' while downloading, it indicates that some files in your folder were uploaded with an older version of SD Connect, making automatic decryption unavailable. To resolve this, please follow the [manual decryption instructions](sd-connect-download-old-version.md). For further assistance, [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).
