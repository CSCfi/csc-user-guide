# Downloading folders and files

You can easily download folders or individual files from SD Connect user interface.

**Automated decryption is available only for files uploaded and automatically encrypted via the user interface after October 1, 2024**. In contrast, files have been uplaoded before October 1 2024, were manually encrypted using your encryption key and will need to be decrypted manually after download. Although both file types use the same .c4h extension, if you see the message "Requested files could not be decrypted" during download, it indicates that the file was encrypted manually and its decryption will require an extra step. If you need any assistance, don't hesitate to contact us.

- .tar file: this is the actual file containing your downloaded folder. 
- .tar.part file: this is a temporary file created while the .tar file is still downloading. 
- **If both the .tar and .tar.part files are still visible, the download is still in progress. The browser will continue the download in the background.**

- Do not open or extract any of the files until the .tar.part file disappears and the .tar file shows a proper file size (not 0 bytes). This indicates that the          download has completed successfully.
    
5. Files are decrypted automatically. The downloaded folder has a .tar extension, double-click to extract the content in a new folder.

!!! Warning
    If you encounter the message 'Some downloaded files need manual decryption.' while downloading, it indicates that some files in your folder were uploaded with an older version of SD Connect, making automatic decryption unavailable. To resolve this, please follow these [instructions](#download-and-manual-decryption). For further assistance, [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).

## Download and manual decryption

For files uploaded vis SD Connect user interface before October 2024. These files will remain encrypted after dowlaod, and you will need to decrypt them manually  on your laptop with the Crypt4GH application by following the provided instructions:

Please note that you can only decrypt one file at a time. If you need to decrypt multiple files at once, a command line option is available. For further assistance, [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).

### 1.1 Preparation

- **Have your private encryption key available.** If you donâ€™t remember the key used, please [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md).

- **Download the Crypt4GH graphical user interface on your laptop.** This tool is necessary for decrypting the files. If you experience any issues installing the tool, especially on a laptop provided by your IT department, please [contact us for assistance](../../support/contact.md).
- Install the Crypt4GH application: CSC has developed a simple application that will allow you to generate your encryption keys and decrypt data when necessary. Download the version specific to your operating system from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui): <!-- (links need to be updated) -->
      - [Mac](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-macos-amd64.zip)
      - [Windows](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-windows-amd64.zip)
      - [Linux](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui/releases/download/v1.3.0/crypt4gh-gui-python3.10-linux-amd64.zip)

      Please check that the tool for Windows has been digitally signed by CSC - IT Center for Science. After the download, you can find the Crypt4GH application in your downloads folder. When you open the application for the first time, you might encounter an error message. In this case, click on _More info_ and verify that the publisher is CSC-IT Center for Science (or in Finnish CSC-Tieteen tietotekniikan keskus Oy) and then click on _Run anyway_.

### 1.2 Download the files from SD Connect

Access SD Connect and locate the files you need. You can download either the entire bucket or individual files. At the end of the download, the user interface will display the message: "Some downloaded files need manual decryption."

### 1.3 Change the file extension

After downloading the files, you need to adjust their extensions. Right-click the file, choose "Rename," and add `.c4gh` to the end of the filename. If opened with a text editor, the files will still be encrypted.

### 1.4 Decrypt the files with the Crypt4gh application

[Video](https://youtu.be/SQJ8QEKV7BE)

 Next, you can decrypt the file using the Crypt4GH application and your secret encryption key. Unfortunately, it is currently only possible to single files.
      1. Open the Crypt4GH application and click on _load Your Private Key_.
      2. Click on _Select File_ and upload the file you want to decrypt.
      3. Click on _Open_.
      4. Next, click on _Decrypt File_.
      5. The tool will ask you to write the secret key's password. Press _ok_.

      The secret key must match the public key used to encrypt the data.

!!! Note
    In the case of decryption, adding the public key is not mandatory, but if you have the public key of the person who has encrypted the file, you can use it to verify the encryption signature. If you don't select a public key, the activity log will display the following (the decryption will be executed anyway):

    ```text
    Sender public key has not been set, authenticity will not be verified.
    ```

If your decryption runs successfully, the activity log will display the following:

```text
Decrypting..... Decryption has finished Decrypted file: C:/users/username/exampledirectory/examplefile
```

The decrypted file will no longer display the `.c4gh` extension and will be saved in the same folder from which the original file was uploaded.
