## Data uplaod 

To automatically upload and encrypt files with SD Connect to a new destination folder, follow these steps:

1. **Select CSC Project**: Go to the SD Connect browser page and choose the relevant CSC project in the top left corner.

2. **Start a new upload**: Click the *Upload* button in the top right corner.
   
3. **Create a new folder**: In the new window, name the destination folder for your files. Please note that folder names cannot be modified after creation. Folder names must be unique across all existing folders in all projects in SD Connect and Allas (the cloud storage solution based on which SD Connect is developed). If you can't create a new folder, another project may already use the name you desire. To avoid this situation, it is good practice to include project-specific identifiers (e.g., project ID number or acronym) in the folder name. Avoid spaces and special characters; use Latin alphabets (a-z), numbers (0-9), dash (-), underscore (_), and dot (.). Remember, all folder names are public; please do not include any confidential information.

4. **Select files to be uploaded**: Click the *Select Files* button to open a browser window and choose files for upload. If you want to upload folders, drag and drop them into the window.

5. **Start upload**: Click the *Upload* button to initiate automatic encryption and upload. Notifications about the upload status will be displayed and visible until the upload is completed. The notification also includes a link to the destination folder.

Once the upload is finished, encrypted files are accessible for download or for analysis, editing, or annotation via the SD Desktop. To add files to an existing destination folder, simply access the folder (double-click on the correct folder) and click on *Upload*. The subsequent window will showcase the folder name, allowing you to proceed by clicking on *Select Files*.

!!! Note
    All members within the same CSC project can download decrypted data stored in SD Connect (Beta). However, this capability can be limited by sharing files in read-only mode. Please check the following paragraph for more details.

**Addittional considerations:**

* SD Connect offers automated encryption/description and key management for all file types and formats (> 100GB). Uploading large or numerous files may take several hours, depending on the internet speed. Note that ongoing uploads will be automatically stopped after 8 hours.

* SD Connect user interface visualises the destination folders where your encrypted data is stored. Think of the destination folder like a virtual box on the internet where you keep your digital filesâ€”like photos or documents. You can not chnage the destination folder name and you can't edit files directly through the user interface, but editing is only possible after downloading on your laptop or by accessing the files and making a copy via SD Desktop.

* Planning how to organise your files in SD Connect destintion folders is a crucial step for efficient data management. Carefully consider storing the files based on projects, themes, or logical structures to enhance accessibility and streamline workflow. A well-thought-out folder structure also facilitates collaboration when sharing access with others. If you have questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact our service desk (servicedesk@csc.fi, subject: sensitive data).

# Data sharing


!!! Note
    When transferring personal data **outside EU** under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) it's crucial to adhere to requirements ensuring privacy and individual rights. Please verify that the destination country or recipient organization offers an adequate level of data protection, as determined by the European Commission. For more information, [click here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en). In the absence of an adequacy decision, alternative safeguards are necessary. Kindly consult your organization's legal office for guidance. Addittionally, CSC as the data processor needs to maintain accurate records of processing activities. Please contact us at servidesk@csc.fi (subject:sensitive data) to report international data transfers (this also includes **adding collaboratos affiliated to an internation organziation as a member of a CSC project**). 


With SD Connect, you can  share folders across different CSC projects. To initiate the sharing process, you'll need the Share IDâ€”a 32-digit code associated with the target CSC project.  The recipient can copy the Share ID from the user interface and provide it to you via email. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects by entering their respective Share IDs in the dedicated window.

The sharing functionality includes three distinct permission levels for various purposes: read-only access, data transfer, and data collection. Below example scenarios demonstrate how the different permission levels in SD Connect can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data-sharing needs. Find the detailed steps for each option below. 

### Read only-access

Use case axample: A research team (Recipient project B) needs access to specific data for reference and analysis, but the data owner (Project A) wants to restrict their ability download a copy of the data directly. Project A shares the data folder with read-only access using SD Connect (Beta), ensuring that Project B members can view and analyze the information via SD Desktop, without dwoloading a copy of the original data.

To provide read-only access to ancrypted sensitive data using the SD service, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a CSC project (referred to as Project A)**: enable service access for SD Connect (Beta). However, do not add any project members.

2. **Create a second CSC project (referred to as Recipient Project B)**: enable service access for both SD Connect (Beta) and SD Desktop, and add the project members.

3. **Select CSC project**: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose  CSC project A in the top left corner.

4. **Share folder**: Log in to SD Connect (Beta), locate the designated folder, and click on *Share*. In the new window, input the Share ID of *Recipient Project B* and select the permission level: *Share via SD Desktop only*. Click on *Share* to proceed.

Now, all the content within the folder is visible within Project B and accessible only through SD Desktop. Project members can access and analyze the shared folder content via the virtual desktop. However, they cannot export or download files, as all data exports are managed directly by the project manager.

Please contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi to discuss this option before proceeding. 



### Data transfer

Use case example: A project team (Project A) has valuable datasets that another team (Recipient project B) needs for analysis. Project A shares the relevant data folder with the Recipient Project with *make a copy* permission, granting them the ability to make a copy. This allows the Recipient Project members to dowload a copy of data, ensuring they have their own working copy for analysis without affecting the original dataset.

To transfer encrypted files to another CSC project please follow these steps:

1. **Select CSC project**: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose the relevant CSC project in the top left corner.

2. **Share folder**: In the *All folders* tab, find the correct folder and on the same row (right-side), click on *Share*. In the new window, input the Share ID of  recipient project and select the permission level: *make a copy*. Click on *Share* to proceed.

Now, all the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient CSC projects. All project members can  copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. Additionally, they can access it via SD Desktop for analysis. 


  
### Data Collection

Use case example: A collaborative research effort involves multiple projects (Project A and Recipient project B). Project A owns a central data workspace  and wants to allow members from the Recipient project B to upload additional files to a specific folder. By sharing the folder with *Manage* permissions, members from both projects can collaboratively add, modify, and access files within the shared folder, facilitating data collection efforts.


To allow another CSC project memebrs to add files to one of your projects folder, for example to callect data,  follow these steps:

1. **Select CSC project**: Navigate to the SD Connect browser page and choose the relevant CSC project in the top left corner.

2. **Share folder**: In the *All folders* tab, find the correct folder and on the same row (right-side), click on *Share*. In the new window, input the Share ID of the recipient project and select the permission level: *manage*. Click on *Share* to proceed.

Now, all the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient CSC projects. Project members can copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content. They can also upload or delete files within the shared folder, accessible to both projects. The folder's content remains accessible via SD Desktop.
