# Sharing folders

SD Connects provides you multiple ways to share your files.

!!! info "Share ID"

    With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. This is done by using Share ID, a unique 32-digit code associated with a CSC project. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects and use different permission levels. 
    
    You need to know the Share ID of the **recipient** CSC project. The recipient can copy the Share ID from the SD Connect user interface (the recipient should select correct CSC project from the top left corner, then click **Copy Share ID** next to the project number) and provide it to you via email. 


## Permission levels and example use cases

Permission levels are Transfer data, Collaborate and Read to SD Desktop. Please read about example use cases which demonstrate how the different permissions can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data sharing needs.


### Transfer data

 The recipient project’s members can copy your folder in SD Connect and download files in decrypted format. Files are also accessible via SD Desktop. Use this when you want to transfer your data to another project.

### Collaborate

In addition to Transfer data permission, the recipient project’s members can upload new files or delete existing files from your folder in SD Connect. Use this when you want the folder to be your shared workspace.

### Read to SD Desktop 

!!! error-label

    Not yet available

The recipient project's members can only access the folder content in SD Desktop. Use this when you need maximum certainty that your files are not distributed further.

!!! warning
    Note that you also have to be the project manager of the recipient project. Please contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi to discuss this option before proceeding.
