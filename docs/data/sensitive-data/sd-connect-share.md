Data sharing

Share ID

With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. To initiate the sharing process, you need to know what is the Share IDâ€”a 32-digit code associated with the recipient CSC project. The recipient can copy the Share ID from the SD Connect user interface (top left cornet) and provide it to you via email. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects by entering their respective Share IDs in the dedicated window.

The sharing functionality includes three distinct permission levels for various purposes: read-only access, data transfer, and data collection.

Below example scenarios demonstrate how the different permission can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data-sharing needs.
