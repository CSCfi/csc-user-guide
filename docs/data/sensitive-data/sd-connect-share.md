# Sharing data

## Using Share ID 

With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. This is done by using Share ID, a unique 32-digit code associated with each CSC project. (screenshot)

You need to know the Share ID of the **recipient** CSC project. The recipient can copy the Share ID from the SD Connect user interface (top left cornet) and provide it to you via email. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects and use different permission levels.

Permission levels are read-only access, data transfer, and data collection. Please read about example scenarios which  demonstrate how the different permission can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data-sharing needs.
