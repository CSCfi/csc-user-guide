# Sharing folders

    With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. This is done by using Share ID, a unique 32-digit code associated with a CSC project. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects and use different permission levels. 

SD Connects provides you multiple ways to share your files. Please read about permission rights and example use cases which demonstrate how the different permissions:

* [Transfer data](#transfer-data)
* [Collaborate](#collaborate)
* [Read to SD Desktop](#read-to-sd-desktop)

## Permission rights and example use cases

 Please read about permission rights and example use cases which demonstrate how the different permissions can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data sharing needs.

### Transfer data

The recipient project’s members can copy your folder in SD Connect and download files in decrypted format. Files are also accessible via SD Desktop. Use this when you want to transfer your data to another project.

[Read about use case: Transfer your data to another project](./sd-connect-share-tranfer-data.md)


### Collaborate

In addition to Transfer data permission, the recipient project’s members can upload new files or delete existing files from your folder in SD Connect. Use this when you want the folder to be your shared workspace.

[Read about use case: Use folder as your shared workspace](./sd-connect-share-workspace.md)



### Read to SD Desktop

The recipient project's members can only access the folder content in SD Desktop. Use this when you need maximum certainty that your files are not distributed further.

!!! warning
    Note that you also have to be the project manager of the recipient project. Please [contact CSC Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) to discuss this option before proceeding.
