# Sharing data

## Share ID 

With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. This is done by using Share ID, a unique 32-digit code associated with each CSC project. (screenshot)

You need to know the Share ID of the **recipient** CSC project. The recipient can copy the Share ID from the SD Connect user interface (in th top left corner next to project number) and provide it to you via email. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects and use different permission levels.

Permission levels are read-only access, data transfer, and data collection. Please read about example scenarios which  demonstrate how the different permission can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data-sharing needs.

### Read only-access

**Use case example:** A research team (recipient project B) needs access to specific data for reference and analysis, but the data owner (Project A) wants to restrict their ability download a copy of the data directly. Project A shares the data folder with read-only access using SD Connect (Beta), ensuring that Project B members can view and analyse the information via SD Desktop, without downloading a copy of the original data.


1. Log in to MyCSC.
2. Create a CSC project (referred to as Project A) and enable service access for SD Connect. Do not add any project members.
3. Create a second CSC project (referred to as Recipient Project B), enable service access for both SD Connec and SD Desktop, and add the project members.
4. Log in to SD Connect.
5. Choose CSC project A in the top left corner.
6. Upload data you want to share to a folder (link) and click **Share**.
7. In the new window, input the Share ID of recipient Project B and select the permission level **Share via SD Desktop only**. Click **Share**.
8. Now, all the content within the folder is visible within Project B and accessible only through SD Desktop. Project members can access and analyse the shared folder content via the virtual desktop. However, they cannot export or download files, as all data exports are managed directly by the project manager.
