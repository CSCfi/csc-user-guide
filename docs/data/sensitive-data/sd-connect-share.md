# Sharing folders

## Share ID 

With SD Connect, you can share folders across different CSC projects. This is done by using Share ID, a unique 32-digit code associated with a CSC project. You can share a folder with multiple CSC projects and use different permission levels. 

You need to know the Share ID of the **recipient** CSC project. The recipient can copy the Share ID from the SD Connect user interface (the recipient should select correct CSC project from the top left corner, then click **Copy Share ID** next to the project number) and provide it to you via email. 


## Permission levels and example use cases

Permission levels are Share via Desktop only, Make a copy and Manage. Please read about example use cases which demonstrate how the different permissions can be applied based on specific collaboration requirements and data sharing needs.

### Permission: Share via Desktop only

!!! warning-label

    For project managers
    

#### Use case example:

A research team (recipient project B) needs access to specific data for reference and analysis, but the data owner (project A) wants to restrict their ability download a copy of the data directly. Project A shares the data folder with **Share via Desktop only** permission, ensuring that project B members can view and analyse the information via SD Desktop, without downloading a copy of the original data.

1. Log in to MyCSC.
2. Create a CSC project (referred to as Project A) and enable service access for SD Connect. Do not add any project members. 
3. Create a second CSC project (referred to as Recipient Project B), enable service access for both SD Connect and SD Desktop, and add the project members.
4. Log in to SD Connect.
5. Choose CSC project B in the top left corner.
6. Copy project B Share ID by clicking **Copy Share ID** next to the project number.
7. Choose CSC project A in the top left corner.
8. Upload data you want to share to a folder.
9. In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row on the right, click **Share**.
10. In the new window, add the Share ID of recipient project B and select the permission level **Share via SD Desktop only**. Click **Share**.
11. Now, all the content within the folder is visible within project B and accessible only through SD Desktop. Project members can access and analyse the shared folder content via the virtual desktop. However, they cannot export or download files, as all data exports are managed directly by the project manager.

### Permission: Make a copy

#### Use case example:

A project team (project A) has valuable datasets that another team (recipient project B) needs for analysis. Project A shares the relevant data folder with the recipient project B with **Make a copy** permission. This allows the recipient project members to download a copy of data, ensuring they have their own working copy for analysis without affecting the original dataset.

1. Log in to SD Connect.
2. Choose project A in the top left corner.
3. In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row on the right, click **Share**.
4. In the new window, add the Share ID of the recipient project B and select the permission level **Make a copy**. Click **Share**.
5. All the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient project B. All project members in project B can now copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. Additionally, they can access it via SD Desktop for analysis.


### Permission: Manage

#### Use case example:

A collaborative research effort involves multiple projects (Project A and Recipient project B). Project A owns a central data workspace and wants to allow members from the Recipient project B to upload additional files to a specific folder. By sharing the folder with ** Manage** permission, members from both projects can collaboratively add, modify, and access files within the shared folder, facilitating data collection efforts.

1. Log in to SD Connect.
2. Choose CSC project A in the top left corner.
3. In the All folders tab, find the correct folder and on the same row on the right, click **Share**.
4. In the new window, add the Share ID of the recipient project B and select the permission level **Manage**. Click **Share**.
5. All the content within the folder is visible within to the recipient project B. All project members in project B can now copy, download, and decrypt the folder's content through SD Connect. They can also upload or delete files within the shared folder, accessible to both projects. The folder's content remains accessible via SD Desktop.
