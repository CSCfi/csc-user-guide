# Sensitive Data (SD) services for research: user guide

Welcome to the user guides for CSC's Sensitive Data (SD) services. 

**These guides are structured based on the type of data involved in your research and the legal grounds for its processing**. Start by identifing the type of confidantial or sensitive data your research involves, whether it is: **research data** (e.g. consented data collected for scientific studies) or **health and social data for seconday use** (e.g. register data provided by the Finnish Social and Health Data Permit Authority, Findata, or a public register). This determines the appropriate CSC project type used to access the services and the access rights for project members.

Each guide provides step-by-step instructions and video tutorials. Use the left menu (if menu is not visible, try zooming out in your browser), search bar or [table of contents](sd-services-toc.md) to find topics quickly.
