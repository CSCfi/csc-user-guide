# Manage CSC project

To access CSC services, you need both a CSC account and membership in a CSC project. This allows you to apply for service access, manage team members, set data permissions and apply for additional resources. Although using SD Connect and SD Desktop is free of charge for research purposes according to CSCâ€™s terms of use, CSC tracks the resources consumed by each CSC project through Billing Units. 


!!! Note: 
    The default lifetime of a CSC project is one year. All data stored in SD Connect or SD Desktop, including files, virtual desktops and volumes, will be permanently deleted 90 days after the project closure/ expiration.

To effectively manage your CSC projects and its resources, please learn more information below:

## Project closure, expiration, and data deletion

The default lifetime of a CSC project is one year. As a project manager, you can either extend the project duration or close it through MyCSC.

*  You will receive an email notification from the MyCSC portal when your project is about to expire. Please keep your contact information up to date in MyCSC to ensure you receive this notification.
* After the project is closed, access to SD Connect and SD Desktop services will be disabled.
* All data stored in SD Connect or SD Desktop, including files, virtual desktops, and volumes, will be permanently deleted 90 days after the project closure/ expiration.

!!! Note
    Once data is deleted in line with CSC's data retention policy, it cannot be restored or recovered.
