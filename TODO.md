# Todo

- Beautify the functionality and the looks according to Ling's advice
- Collaborate with My CSC development for common look and feel?
- fix Windmill theme bugs
    - side navigation does not hide properly if header are too long and browser
      window is narrow
    - confusing(?) '#' in the address bar
- before "The Grand opening", create new repository docs-csc-2019, and make
  "Inital commit" from this repo (note the year in the repo name, expecting that
  the repo history needs to be cleaned every now and then...)
- add version number to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and update versions
  to match
  [conda-docs-env-0.1.yaml](docs/support/tutorials/conda/conda-docs-env-0.1.yaml)

- Add a general style guide
