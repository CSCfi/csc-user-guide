!!! warning "Multi-factor authentication soon required to log in to Puhti and Mahti web interfaces"
    Starting 21 April 2025, the web interfaces of Puhti and Mahti will require
    multi-factor authentication (MFA). We strongly encourage all our users to
    test and activate multi-factor authentication as soon as possible to ensure
    uninterrupted access to the services.

    1. [Test whether **Haka MFA** is already enabled for you](/accounts/mfa.md#mfa-instructions-for-users-logging-in-with-haka-credentials).
          * If your home organization has enabled MFA for Haka login, you do not need to activate MFA separately for CSC services. It is highly preferred that you use the Haka MFA of your home organization if possible.
    2. [If Haka MFA is not enabled or if your home organization does not offer Haka, activate **CSC MFA** following these instructions](/accounts/mfa.md#how-to-activate-mfa).
