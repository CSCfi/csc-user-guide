!!! warning "Multi-factor authentication soon required to log in to Puhti and Mahti web interfaces"
    Starting 21 April 2025, the web interfaces of Puhti and Mahti will require
    multi-factor authentication (MFA). We strongly encourage all our users to
    test and activate multi-factor authentication as soon as possible to ensure
    uninterrupted access to the services.

    1. [Test whether Haka MFA is already enabled for you](https://my.csc.fi/test-mfa).
          * If your home organization has enabled MFA for Haka login, you do not need to activate it separately for CSC services.
    2. [If Haka MFA is not enabled, activate MFA following these instructions](/accounts/mfa.md#activation-of-mfa).
