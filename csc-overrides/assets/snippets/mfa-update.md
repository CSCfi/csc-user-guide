!!! warning "Multi-factor authentication required to log in to Puhti and Mahti web interfaces"
    Since 22 April 2025, the web interfaces of Puhti and Mahti require
    multi-factor authentication (MFA).

    1. If your home organization has enabled MFA for Haka login, you do not need to activate MFA separately for CSC services. It is highly preferred that you use the Haka MFA of your home organization if possible.
    2. If Haka MFA is not enabled or if your home organization does not offer Haka, [activate **CSC MFA** following these instructions](/accounts/mfa.md#how-to-activate-csc-mfa).
