!!! warning "SSH certificates are required to connect to Roihu over SSH"

    To connect to Roihu, users must sign their public key in MyCSC to obtain a
    time-based SSH certificate. Each certificate is valid for 24 hours, and
    once it expires, a new one must be generated by signing the public key
    again.

    [Read the detailed instructions on signing your public key](/computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md#signing-public-key).
