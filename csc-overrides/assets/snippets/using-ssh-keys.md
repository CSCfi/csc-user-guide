!!! info "Using SSH keys"
    See the page on [setting up SSH keys](/computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md)
    for general information about using SSH keys and certificates for
    authentication. Please note that it is mandatory to add your public key to
    MyCSC – copying it directly to a CSC supercomputer does not work!

    Supported key types are Ed25519 and RSA 4096 through 16384. **We strongly
    recommend Ed25519**.
