!!! warning "Significant changes to authentication coming in April 2025"
    Starting April 21, logging in to Puhti and Mahti web interfaces will
    require multi-factor authentication (MFA). We encourage all users with a
    CSC account to activate two-factor authentication as soon as possible to
    avoid any interruption in service access. If your home organization already
    implements MFA as part of Haka logins, then you are all set and there is no
    need to additionally set up multi-factor authentication in MyCSC.
  
    [Read the detailed instructions on setting up MFA](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/mfa/#activation-of-mfa).
