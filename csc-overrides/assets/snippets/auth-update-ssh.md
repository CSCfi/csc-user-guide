!!! warning "Significant changes to authentication coming in April 2025"
    Starting April 14 2025, SSH login to Puhti and Mahti will only work using
    SSH keys added in MyCSC. Password authentication and public keys stored in
    users' personal `~/.ssh` folder on the supercomputer will no longer work.
    This authentication method is already in use on LUMI.

    [Read the detailed instructions on setting up and using SSH keys](../../computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md).
