!!! warning "SSH keys are required to connect to Puhti and Mahti over SSH"
    Since April 14th 2025, connecting to Puhti and Mahti over SSH only works
    using SSH keys added in MyCSC. Password authentication and public keys
    stored in users' personal `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the
    supercomputer no longer works.

    [Read the detailed instructions on setting up and using SSH keys](/computing/connecting/ssh-keys.md).
