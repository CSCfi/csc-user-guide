  &#x2615; Welcome to our weekly research support coffee hour on Zoom! <a href="https://csc.fi/en/training-calendar/csc-research-support-coffee-every-wednesday-at-1400-finnish-time-2-2/" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a> &#x2615;

{# Remember
  - to set the announcement_visible to true in mkdocs.yml
  - that the announcement bar has only been tested with <p> and <a>
  - to include a target="_blank" attribute in external links
  - to not have loose text outside of a <p> (or an <a>)
  - that you can garnish the announcement with emojis by using their code
    points with HTML entities, for example &#x2615; for the "hot beverage" emoji.
  - to not use the literal 'docs.csc.fi' for internal links,
    use href="{{ base_url|url }}/path/to/page/" instead
