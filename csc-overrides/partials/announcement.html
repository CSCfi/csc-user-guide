</p>
{# Remember
  - to set the announcement_visible to true in mkdocs.yml
  - that the announcement bar has only been tested with <p> and <a>
  - to include a target="_blank" attribute in external links
  - to not have loose text outside of a <p> (or an <a>)
  - that you can garnish the announcement with emojis by using their code
    points with HTML entities, for example &#x2615; for the "hot beverage" emoji.
