{# Put the announcement, in HTML, right under this comment! #}
<p>
  &#128221; CSC is collecting feedback about your Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) related needs. <a href="https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/0D663B17FB1E52A2" target="_blank">Answer the survey here</a>! &#128221;
</p>
{# Remember
  - to set the announcement_visible to true in mkdocs.yml
  - that the announcement bar has only been tested with <p> and <a>
  - to include a target="_blank" attribute in external links
  - to not have loose text outside of a <p> (or an <a>)
  - that you can garnish the announcement with emojis by using their code
    points with HTML entities, for example &#x2615; for the "hot beverage" emoji.
  - to not use the literal 'docs.csc.fi' for internal links,
    use href="{{ base_url|url }}/path/to/page/" instead
