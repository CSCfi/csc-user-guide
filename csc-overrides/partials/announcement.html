  Remember
    - to not use the literal 'docs.csc.fi' for internal links,
      - use href="{{ base_url | url }}/path/to/page/" instead
    - to set the announcement_visible to true in mkdocs.yml
    - that the announcement bar has only been tested with <p> and <a>
    - to include a target="_blank" attribute in external links
    - to not have loose text outside of a <p> (or an <a>)
