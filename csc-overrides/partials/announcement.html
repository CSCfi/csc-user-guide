  &#128679; Please note: There will be a service break on <b>Mahti</b> on Tuesday 3 September from 08:00 to 21:00. <a href="https://research.csc.fi/-/280351-87" target="_blank">Click here for more information</a>. &#128679;
</p>
{# Remember
  - to set the announcement_visible to true in mkdocs.yml
  - that the announcement bar has only been tested with <p> and <a>
  - to include a target="_blank" attribute in external links
  - to not have loose text outside of a <p> (or an <a>)
  - that you can garnish the announcement with emojis by using their code
    points with HTML entities, for example &#x2615; for the "hot beverage" emoji.
  - to not use the literal 'docs.csc.fi' for internal links,
    use href="{{ base_url|url }}/path/to/page/" instead
